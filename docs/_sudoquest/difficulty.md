We should look at difficulty and try and touch stuff that will help the players.

## Sudoku Difficulty Tweaks

- Do we want to adjust rewards based on difficulty?

### Easier

- Auto-Show Note Numbers - Will automatically show note or small numbers in the boxes on the grid.
- Auto Solver - Select a square and the number will appear

### More Difficult

- Enemy Auto Fill - Enemies have access to a solved puzzle to always get the best mana they can.
- Enemy Solve AI - Enemies can have various access algorithms so the solves are based on logic and not the existing solutions.
- Battle AI Levels - Have different levels for what skills the enemies have access to and how smart they are with usage. Perhaps three different levels.
- Turn Timer - Each combatant has a certain amount of time to solve a square, do we instead confer a bonus for quick solutions?
