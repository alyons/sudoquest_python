This will literally be the gambit system from FFXII

The only available actions will be skills

When will the gambits run?

How will the enemy decide if it's time to use the right skills?

## What are the triggers?

- Depends on what skills can do
- How do we handle skills which have cooldowns?
- Depends on stats of combatants
