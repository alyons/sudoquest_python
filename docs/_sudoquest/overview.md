Welcome to [world name here]!

## Concept

This is the world of Sudokuest, a fantasy world where mana is plentiful and there is a large peace… or so it seemed. The King of Garnesia knows of a prophecy which foretells of a great evil arising in the near future, which threatens the very world. You, the hero of this land, have been chosen to set forth and vanquished this evil, slaying a host of foes along the way. The interesting thing of this world is that all battles are now battles of wits, played across a Sudoku game board, summoning mana to unleash devastating attacks on your foes, or shielding yourself from harm.  
This game is a role playing, turn-based strategy game, in which the battle system is balanced around solving a Sudoku.

## Game Flow Summary

The player will move through their current campaign by completing quest until the campaign is finished. Each quest will be activated by certain prerequisites being filled. Once the quest becomes available, the player can choose to accept it by watching the introductory cut scene, in which they will learn what is needed to complete the quest. Once this is done, it is up to the player to fulfill all of the requirements to complete the quest. With the requirements complete, the player will have to talk to a character to complete the quest and receive their reward. With the quest being completed, more quests will be unlocked which will allow the player to progress through their campaign, and eventually finish it.  
For battle, each combatant (player and enemy) will take it in turns to use skills and gather resources. In specific, a combatant’s turn will begin with the activation of any persistent abilities on them (damage over time, walls losing time on the field, et cetera). Once this is done, the combatant may choose to use a skill, given that they have the mana to use that skill. Once this is done, they combatant must solve a tile on the battle grid, which gives that combatant mana to use skills. After this, it is the other combatants turn. This will happen until one of the combatants is defeated (their health reaches zero).  
To get to all of these battles and cut scenes, the player will have to navigate a map. The map will have nodes on it which represent specific locations, and will allow the player to access different battles and quests. As the player completes more of the campaign, new nodes will become available to them, which in turn will give them more content.
