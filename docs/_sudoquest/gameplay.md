### Quest Structure

Throughout the playerâ€™s play time, there are quests found for the player to embark upon. Quests are tasks that yields the player rewards, such as experience, currency, and items. Some quests also allow the player to advance through the main storyline of the game. Quests can be found by indicators on the world map.  
Quests come from NPCs and are given to the player by interacting with them. However, there are some quests that can only be accessed by meeting certain requirements.  
To take part in quests, the player needs to interact with a quest NPC. The quest NPC provides the player with information, such as the quest background, quest objective, and quest reward. The quest NPC then waits for the player to accomplish the task. Once the quest is accomplished, the player can talk to the quest NPC to finish the quest. After finishing the quest, the player receives the quest reward.  
There are two quest types found in the game: story and side quests. Story quests are tasks that help the player progress through the story. Side quests are tasks that provide the player extra challenges aside from the challenges provided by the main story.

### Free Matches

Players duke it out with their characters from story mode.

### Balanced Matches

How will we do this? (Uses a few pre-built characters as well as the availability for the player to make a character to use in balanced matches with certain limitations on items and skill points. This will also include an ELO system to help match players better.)
