## Sudoku

- [Sudoku Techniques](https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/sudoku/techniques)

## Other

- Do we want mana burn? (Mana overflow has some negative effect)
- Do we want a karma system? (given choices, this effects other things within the game)
  - No inherently a good vs evil, more who likes you and who doesn't.
  - We would need factions
  - We would need individuals
  - high karma: better prices, better items, more items, unlock companion
  - low karma: cannot enter certain areas, higher prices, unavailable items or quests
