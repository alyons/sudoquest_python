[Tutorial on Hex Grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/)

The map will represent the world, and will be broken up into hexes. Each hex will have a type.

## Types of Hexes

1. Forest
2. Town
3. Plains
4. Desert
5. Mountain
6. Tundra
7. Swamp
8. Deadlands (low mana?)
9. Road (modifier for some hexes, allowing faster travel)

## Fog of Discovery

The player can only see so many hexes from their current location and what they have explored.

The player can see if an enemy is on a hex.

## Random Travel Events

Given traveling, the player might encounter random events.

1. Battle
2. Mini Cutscene (World Building, Choice)
