This will be designed for each screen and added into this document. For these interfaces I would like to have mock up screens with distinct colored regions which show things such as data areas, interactive areas, et cetera. Should this be done before the design is complete, or should we wait for the story and mechanics to be completed? Also, is there a possibility for making dynamic content attachable to the images and such for this game (i.e. truly dynamic content).  
To interface with the game, the player will use a keyboard and mouse. Blah, blah, blah; human computer interaction stuff will go here, but I think we get the idea of people using a mouse and keyboard.
