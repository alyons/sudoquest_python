title: "Statuses"
---

Combat in the FFRPG isn't limited to damage and healing; Status
Conditions play just as great a role in the outcome of a battle. Many
are consequences of indirect offensive strategies, but some are
designed to defend and enhance combatants’ abilities, giving them
an important edge in tough battles.  
The considerable impact Status Conditions can have on the
battlefield makes their removal a prime tactical consideration.
Though most expire after a certain period of time, it may be in a
combatant’s best interests to get rid of them as soon as they arise.
Each Condition therefore has its own set of ‘cures’, any of which will
serve to remove – or ‘cancel’ – it before the timer hits 0. The
alternative is to finish the battle as quickly as possible; for Status
Conditions with a limited duration, the Condition is automatically
cancelled once the battle concludes, regardless of how many
Rounds are left on the timer. Conditions with an unlimited duration,
however, will endure after battle, and last until healed by items,
magic, or recuperation.  
The following section deals with both positive and negative Status
Conditions, detailing their effects as well as their remedies. The
negative Conditions are divided into seven categories based on
similarity of effect; positive Conditions are grouped into two.

## Status Immunities

Some combatants may have an Immunity (I) to a given Status
Condition or category of Status Conditions. When any said Condition
– or a Condition belonging to the Status category in question – is
used against the combatant, their Immunity automatically reduces its
CoS to 0.

### Fatal

Any Status Condition with the potential to instantly remove its victim
from the fight. For purposes of calculating immunities to effects, the
Fatal category also includes several related ‘conditions’ which are
not Status Conditions in their own right, but still are considered
Fatal-type effects.

#### Condemned
**Effect:** A sinister spectre appears over the combatant, placing a fatal
curse upon them before vanishing into thin air. When the combatant
is first afflicted with Condemned, a four-Round timer starts. Should
the timer reach 0 before the battle ends, the combatant’s life
essences are torn from their body, instantly reducing them to 0 HP,
regardless of their current HP, ARM, and M. ARM ratings.  
**Canceled by:** None

#### Death
The catchall category for any Ability that reduces a target to 0 HP,
regardless of current Hit Points, ARM or M. ARM ratings. This
includes the Equipment Abilities Death Touch and Death Strike.

#### Eject
The catchall category for any Ability that physically removes the
target from the battlefield. As they are not actually ‘defeated’ by
doing so, Ejected opponents award no Items. Gil and XP gained from
an Ejected opponent are reduced by 50%.

#### Frozen
**Effect:** The combatant is frozen solid, caked with a layer of ice thick
enough to prevent them from performing any Actions or Zero
Actions until Frozen expires. If struck by Physical damage whilst in
this state, the resulting shock will reduce the Frozen combatant to 0
HP, regardless of current Hit Points, ARM, or M. ARM ratings. If
necessary, the combatant’s body can be carried around by allies
until Frozen wears off.  
**Canceled by:** Fire Elemental Damage, Esuna

#### Gravity
The catchall category for any Ability that does damage based on a
percentage of the target’s HP or MP, rather than a fixed amount.

#### Heat
**Effect:** A crackling shroud of intense heat surrounds the combatant,
leaving them on the verge of collapse. Should the combatant make
any Actions or Zero Actions while Heat is in effect, the resulting flareup
will reduce the combatant to 0 HP, regardless of current Hit
Points, ARM, or M. ARM ratings. The effects of Heat are always
applied before the results of the Zero Action or Action that triggered
it.  
**Canceled by:** Ice Elemental Damage, Esuna

### Near-Fatal
The catchall category for any Ability that reduces a target to 1 HP,
regardless of current Hit Points, ARM, or M. ARM ratings.

### Mystify

Status Conditions that affect a combatant’s mental faculties.

#### Berserk
**Effect:** The combatant is consumed with indescribable fury,
abandoning tactics for an outright fighting frenzy. Generate Initiative
as normal; whenever the combatant is eligible to make an Action,
they make an immediate Attack Action against the nearest opponent
or inanimate object, striking for +50% damage. Should multiple
eligible targets exist, randomly determine which one is attacked.  
**Canceled by:** Tranquilizer, Remedy, Wash, Esuna

#### Charm
**Effect:** The combatant becomes besotted with an opponent, obeying
their every command. Generate Initiative as normal; whenever the
combatant is eligible to make an Action, the combatant who originally
inflicted Charm may choose what Action their victim takes, if any.
Should the combatant who inflicted Charm be killed or otherwise
incapacitated before the Status is canceled, their victim will instead
make an Attack Action against a random ally every time they are
eligible to act. The same applies for situations where an ally – or the
combatant themselves – inflicted this Status Condition.  
**Canceled by:** Physical Damage, Esuna

#### Confuse
**Effect:** The combatant's mind becomes clouded, distorting their
perception of reality. Generate Initiative as normal; whenever the
character is eligible to make an Action, roll a d8 and consult the
table below to determine what the character does. With only one
exception, all of the effects listed are Target: Random.
d8 Character’s Action
1. Use Spell/Ability against ally. The combatant uses their
weakest Ability or one randomly-determined Spell of the
lowest available Level, targeting one ally. If neither is an
option, re-roll and apply the new result instead.
2. Recover ally. The combatant uses a Recovery Item or
Spell on one randomly-determined ally; this will always
be the most expensive Item or MP-intensive Spell at their
disposal. If neither is an option, re-roll and apply the
new result instead.
3. Attack random ally. The combatant makes an immediate
Attack Action against a randomly-determined ally, using
whatever Weapon they currently have equipped. Roll to
hit and calculate damage as normal.
4. Attack self. The combatant makes an immediate Attack
Action against themselves, using whatever Weapon they
currently have equipped. Roll to hit and calculate
damage as normal.
5. Attack random opponent. The combatant makes an
immediate Attack Action against a random opponent,
using whatever Weapon they currently have equipped.
Roll to hit and calculate damage as normal.
6. Attack random ally. The combatant makes an immediate
Attack Action against a randomly-determined ally, using
whatever Weapon they currently have equipped. Roll to
hit and calculate damage as normal.
7. Recover opponent. The victim uses a Recovery Item or
Spell on one randomly-determined opponent; this will
always be the weakest Item or least MP-intensive Spell at
their disposal. If neither is an option, re-roll and apply
the new result instead.
8. Use Spell/Ability against opponent. The victim uses either
their strongest Ability or one randomly-determined Spell
from the highest available Level, targeting one random
opponent. If neither is an option, re-roll and apply the
new result instead.

**Canceled by:** Physical Damage, Remedy, Esuna

#### Unaware
**Effect:** The combatant is distracted, leaving themselves open to
attack. Until they receive a turn, the next attack that deals Physical
damage against them inflicts +100% damage. In addition,
combatants under the effects of Unaware cannot roll to prevent an
opponent from making a successful Escape Action. If a combatant is
under the effects of Unaware when their turn arrives, they take no
action. Instead, Unaware is canceled.  
**Canceled by:** Physical Damage, Action, Alarm Clock

### Toxin
Status Conditions of a toxic nature.

#### Poison
**Effect:** The combatant is afflicted with a virulent poison, turning them
a sickly shade of purple. For every Status Phase that Poison remains
untreated for, the combatant loses a number of Hit Points equal to
10% of their current HP. A combatant with a total of 500 HP would
lose 50 HP the first Round, 45 the next, 40 the Round after that,
and so on.  
**Canceled by:** Antidote, Remedy, Poisona, Wash, Esuna

#### Venom
**Effect:** A fast-acting, lethal poison has entered the combatant's body.
For every Status Phase that a combatant afflicted with Venom
remains untreated for, they lose a number of Hit and Magic Points
equal to 10% of their respective maximum values. A combatant with
a total of 500 HP and 250 MP, for instance, would lose 50 HP and
25 MP for each Status Phase Venom stays in effect.  
**Canceled by:** Antidote, Remedy, Poisona, Esuna

### Seal
Status Conditions that prevent a combatant from making actions in
combat, or otherwise impair their ability to use their full arsenal of
offensive powers.

#### Blind
**Effect:** A dark haze settles over the combatant, severely impairing
their ability to locate opponents. Whilst afflicted with Blind, the
combatant’s ACC is reduced by 50%. In addition, any Critical Hits
scored when making the to-hit roll are ignored. Abilities that take an
Attack Action as a basis – or do damage based on the currently
equipped Weapon – have a flat CoS of 75% for as long as Blind
remains in effect. Similarly, Skill and Attribute Ratings for Task Checks
that require use of sight are reduced by 50%.  
**Canceled by:** Eye Drops, Remedy, Wash, Esuna

#### Curse
**Effect:** A sinister black aura forms around the combatant, sealing
away their chi. A combatant afflicted by Curse may make no Slow or
Fast Ability Actions until cured of the Status Condition. Magic,
Reaction and Support Abilities are unaffected. VIT, SPR, and MAG
Attribute Ratings are reduced by 50% for purposes of making Task
Checks for as long as Curse is active.  
**Canceled by:** Holy Water, Remedy, Esuna, Aura

#### Petrify
**Effect:** The combatant’s body begins to harden, flesh slowly turning
to stone. When the combatant is first afflicted with Petrify, a four-
Round timer starts. Should the timer reach 0 before the battle ends,
the petrification is complete; the combatant is turned to stone on the
spot with the same effects as the Stone Status Condition.  
**Canceled by:** Soft, Remedy, Stona, Esuna

#### Silence
**Effect:** A zone of absolute silence forms around the combatant; while
sound penetrates in a normal fashion, they themselves can't even
hear themselves breathe, let alone speak. Until cured, a character
afflicted by Silence may not use Magic Abilities. All Skill and Attribute
Ratings for Task Checks requiring use of speech are reduced by
50%.  
**Canceled by:** Echo Screen, Remedy, Esuna

#### Sleep
**Effect:** The combatant falls asleep on the spot, completely oblivious
to the dangers around them. Until this Status Condition is cured, the
combatant may make no Actions or Zero Actions during the course
of the Round, though they continue to generate Initiative as normal
and may take their turn if the Condition is canceled before it comes
up. The combatant’s EVA is also reduced to 0 for as long as Sleep
remains in effect. If necessary, the combatant’s body can be carried
by an ally until Sleep wears off.  
**Canceled by:** Physical Damage, Alarm Clock, Remedy, Wash, Esuna

#### Stone
**Effect:** The combatant is turned into solid stone: impervious to all
damage and Status Conditions, but unable to make any Actions or
Zero Actions until Stone has been cured. If necessary, the
combatant’s body can be carried by an ally until Stone wears off.  
**Canceled by:** Soft, Remedy, Stona, Esuna

### Time
Status Conditions that affect a combatant’s place in the flow of time.

#### Disable
**Effect:** The combatant is afflicted with a sluggish numbness, greatly
restricting their ability to act. Until cured, a combatant afflicted with
Disable may not make any Attack, Item or Defend Actions. STR, AGI,
and SPD Attribute Ratings are reduced by 50% for purposes of
making Task Checks for as long as Disable is active.  
**Canceled by:** Bandage, Remedy, Esuna

#### Immobilize
**Effect:** The combatant is rooted to the spot, unable to advance or
retreat in any fashion. Until cured, a combatant afflicted with
Immobilize may not make any Full-Move Actions during the course of
the Round, and cannot attempt or prevent Escape Actions.
Furthermore, their EVA is reduced by 50%. Task Checks requiring
the use of movement automatically fail for as long as Immobilize
remains active.  
**Canceled by:** Bandage, Remedy, Esuna

#### Sap
**Effect:** The combatant bleeds life force, gradually moving closer to
death. At the beginning of every Status Phase that Sap remains
untreated for, the combatant loses 5 HP for every 1 point of
Initiative they generated in the previous Initiative Phase.  
**Canceled by:** Chronos Tear, Remedy, Esuna

#### Slow
**Effect:** The combatant is trapped in a pocket of localized time;
reactions are more sluggish than usual, making it virtually
impossible for them to gain the initiative over their opponents.
Targets affected by Slow halve their Initiative scores during the
Initiative Phase when determining the order of combat, and have
their Skill and Attribute Ratings reduced by 50% for purposes of
Task Checks requiring fast action or movement.  
**Canceled by:** Chronos Tear, Remedy, Esuna, Haste, Stop

#### Stop
**Effect:** The combatant becomes frozen in stasis. No time passes for
the combatant; they do not generate Initiative, and may make no
Actions or Zero Action for as long as Stop remains active. Gains or
losses for Status Conditions like Poison, Regen and Venom are not
calculated while Stop remains in effect; Status Condition timers –
with the exception of that of Stop itself – will not decrease until Stop
has been removed. This includes the specialized timers used by
Petrify and Condemned. If necessary, the combatant’s body can be
carried by an ally until Stop wears off.  
**Canceled by:** Chronos Tear, Esuna

### Transform
Status Conditions that affect a combatant’s physical shape.

#### Mini
**Effect:** The combatant shrinks to a mere fraction of their former size.
While in this state, the combatant’s ARM and M. ARM are both
reduced by 50%; all Physical damage dealt by the combatant is
reduced to 1 damage, regardless of Strength, equipped Weapon or
the target’s ARM rating. Other Abilities continue to function as
normal, and are not affected by this Status. All Task Checks using the
combatant’s STR and VIT Attribute Ratings will automatically fail as
long as Mini is active. Stealth and Escape rolls, however, gain a 50%
bonus.  
**Canceled by:** Cornucopia, Remedy, Esuna, Mini

#### Toad
**Effect:** The combatant is turned into a slimy, croaking toad. While in
this state, the combatant’s ARM and M. ARM are both reduced by
50%; all successful Attack Actions made by the combatant inflict 1
damage, regardless of Strength, equipped weapon or the target’s
ARM rating. The combatant cannot make any Ability Actions while in
this form; should they possess the Black Magic Spell Toad, however,
it may be cast as normal. All Task Checks taken while in Toad form –
other than those involving Stealth, Swimming, Escape, or related
activities – will automatically fail. Rolls against the latter Skills gain a
50% bonus.  
**Canceled by:** Maiden's Kiss, Remedy, Esuna, Toad

#### Zombie
**Effect:** The combatant is drained of their life force, transforming
them into a green-skinned zombie. As they are effectively undead,
Recovery effects that would normally restore HP instead inflict an
equivalent amount of damage, not modified for ARM or M. ARM. A
Hi-Potion, for instance, causes 250 HP damage to a combatant with
Zombie. Any effect that revives an unconscious combatant or
restores Hit Points to maximum instead has a CoS of (M. ACC - 50),
M. Evasion of instantly reducing a Zombied combatant to 0 HP,
regardless of current Hit Points, ARM, or M. ARM.
Drain attacks are also reversed; all damage inflicted by such an
attack on a target affected by Zombie is subtracted from the
attacker’s HP instead, with the combatant regaining an amount of
HP equivalent to that lost by its attacker. In addition to this, the
combatant gains Immunity to Death-type Status Conditions and
Condemned for as long as Zombie remains in effect.
For purposes of resolving Task Checks which use Social Skills, the
character’s Skill Ratings are decreased by 50% for as long as
Zombie remains in effect.  
**Canceled by:** Holy Water, Remedy, Wash, Esuna

### Weaken
Status Conditions which diminish a combatant’s general fighting
ability.

#### Agility Break
**Effect:** The combatant feels sluggish and heavy; all sense of
coordination seems to leave them. For as long as Agility Break
remains in effect, the combatant’s EVA and ACC are both decreased
by 50%; The characters initiative score is decreased by 4 when
calculated at the start of the round. For purposes of Task Checks,
the character’s AGI Rating is also decreased by 50%.  
**Canceled by:** Esuna, Agility Up, Agility Down

#### Agility Down
**Effect:** The combatant’s movements become awkward and
uncoordinated. For as long as Agility Down remains in effect, the
combatant’s EVA and ACC are both decreased by 25%; The
characters initiative score is decreased by 2 when calculated at the
start of the round. For purposes of Task Checks, the character’s AGI
Rating is also decreased by 25%.  
**Canceled by:** Esuna, Agility Up, Agility Break

#### Armor Break
**Effect:** The combatant feels fragile and vulnerable at once; formerlyimpervious
defenses suddenly seem inadequate at best. The
combatant’s ARM is reduced by 50% for as long as Armor Break
remains in effect.  
**Canceled by:** Esuna, Armor Up, Armor Down

#### Armor Down
**Effect:** The combatant’s defenses are weakened, making them more
vulnerable to incoming attacks. The combatant’s ARM is decreased
by 25% for as long as Armor Down remains in effect.  
**Canceled by:** Esuna, Armor Up, Armor Break

#### Element Weak
**Effect:** The combatant is temporarily left vulnerable to a specific
Combat Element. Treat this as if the combatant had a Weakness (W)
to the Element in question.  
**Canceled by:** Esuna, Element Resist, Element Immune, Element
Absorb

#### Lock
**Effect:** A glowing set of crosshairs encloses the combatant, magically
guiding incoming attackers. EVA and M. EVA are both reduced by 20
for as long as Lock remains in effect.  
**Canceled by:** Esuna

#### Magic Break
**Effect:** The combatant’s spellcasting powers weaken; fireballs
suddenly sizzle rather than scorch and other elemental destruction
is a mere shadow of its former self. For as long as Magic Break
remains in effect, all magical damage inflicted by the combatant is
reduced by -50%.  
**Canceled by:** Remedy, Magic Up, Magic Down, Esuna

#### Magic Down
**Effect:** The combatant feels their innate mystical energies dulling,
compromising their ability to channel magic. For as long as Magic
Down remains in effect, all magical damage inflicted by the
combatant is reduced by -25%.  
**Canceled by:** Remedy, Magic Up, Magic Break, Esuna

#### Meltdown
**Effect:** A hazy, deep-red aura forms around the combatant,
rendering all armor useless. The combatant’s ARM and M. ARM are
both reduced to 0 for as long as Meltdown remains in effect. For
purposes of Task Checks, the character’s VIT Rating is also
decreased by 25%.  
**Canceled by:** Remedy, Esuna

#### Mental Break
**Effect:** The combatant’s mental defenses fade, leaving them highly
vulnerable to hostile magic. The combatant’s M. ARM is decreased
by 50% for as long as Mental Break remains in effect. For purposes
of Task Checks, the character’s MAG Rating is also decreased by
50%.  
**Canceled by:** Remedy, Mental Up, Mental Down, Esuna

#### Mental Down
**Effect:** The combatant’s innate magical defenses suddenly weaken,
diminishing their ability to weather incoming spells. The combatant’s
M. ARM is decreased by 25% for as long as Mental Down remains in
effect. For purposes of Task Checks, the character’s MAG Rating is
also decreased by 25%.  
**Canceled by:** Remedy, Mental Up, Mental Break, Esuna

#### Power Break
**Effect:** The combatant feels all strength deserting them, robbing
their blows of any impact they might have once possessed. For as
long as Power Break remains in effect, all physical damage inflicted
by the combatant is reduced by -50%; for purposes of Task Checks,
the character’s STR Rating is also decreased by 50%.  
**Canceled by:** Remedy, Power Up, Power Down, Esuna

#### Power Down
**Effect:** The combatant feels strangely weak; where they strike, their
attacks cannot muster as much force as usual. For as long as Power
Down remains in effect, all physical damage inflicted by the
combatant is reduced by -25%; for purposes of Task Checks, the
character’s STR Rating is also decreased by 25%.  
**Canceled by:** Remedy, Power Up, Power Break, Esuna

#### Spirit Break
**Effect:** The combatant feels dull-witted and scatter-brained, utterly
unable to concentrate for any length of time. For as long as Spirit
Break remains in effect, the combatant’s M. EVA and M. ACC are
both reduced by 50%. For purposes of Task Checks, the character’s
SPR Rating is also decreased by 50%.  
**Canceled by:** Remedy, Spirit Up, Spirit Down, Esuna

#### Spirit Down
**Effect:** The combatant loses concentration, finding it difficult to focus
intensively on any one thing. For as long as Spirit Down remains in
effect, the combatant’s M. EVA and M. ACC are both reduced by
25%; for purposes of Task Checks, the character’s SPR Rating is
also decreased by 25%.  
**Canceled by:** Remedy, Spirit Up, Spirit Down, Esuna

### Barrier
Status Conditions that create distinctive energy fields around
combatants, increasing their defense against certain types of attack.

#### Element Absorb
**Effect:** The combatant is temporarily steeped in a specific Combat
Element, allowing them to absorb all damage associated with it.
Treat this as if the combatant had an Absorbance (A) to the Element
in question.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Debarrier, Element Weak

#### Element Immune
**Effect:** The combatant is temporarily immune to the effects of a
specific Combat Element, allowing them to negate all damage
associated with it. Treat this as if the combatant had an Immunity (I)
to the Element in question.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Debarrier, Element Weak, Element Absorb

#### Element Resist
**Effect:** The combatant is temporarily fortified against a specific
Combat Element. Treat this as if the combatant had a Resistance (R)
to the Element in question.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Debarrier, Element Weak, Element Immune,
Element Absorb

#### Element Spikes
**Effect:** The combatant is surrounded by a hazy, colored energy field;
as opponents draw near, the energy solidifies, turning into wicked
spikes of fire, ice or surging thunder. Any successful non-Ranged
Attack made against the combatant triggers the Element Spikes,
inflicting (2 x MAG) Elemental damage on the attacker. The Element
in question is determined when Element Spikes is first applied.
Damage inflicted by Element Spikes is not reduced by M. ARM, but
may be adjusted for Elemental Weaknesses, Immunities and the like.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Debarrier

#### Protect
**Effect:** The combatant is encased in a cocoon of power which
absorbs the kinetic energy of incoming attacks. Whenever a
combatant under the effects of Protect is struck by Physical damage
or Elemental damage reduced by Armor, that damage is reduced by
50% after it has been modified for ARM.
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Debarrier

#### Reflect
**Effect:** The combatant is surrounded by a blue aura capable of
deflecting magical energies back at their respective sources.
Whenever a Spell hits a combatant affected by Reflect, there is a
chance that the magic will instead bounce off to strike a random
opponent. Whether or not this depends on the Spell, and will be
given in the Spell’s individual description.  
Spells that target multiple combatants will reflect once for each
combatant with Reflect struck. For instance, a Fira Spell inflicting 60
Fire Elemental damage before ARM, striking two combatants with
Reflect, would result in two 60-damage Fira Spells bouncing back at
random opponents. Any given Spell can only be reflected once,
however; Reflect has no effect on magic already reflected off
another target.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Debarrier

#### Resist
**Effect:** The combatant is inoculated against all harmful and abnormal
conditions. For as long as Resist remains in effect, the combatant is
considered to have Immunity to all Fatal-type, Mystify-type, Sealtype,
Time-type Toxin-type, Transform-type and Weaken-type Status
Conditions.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel

#### Shell
**Effect:** The combatant is encased in a cocoon of power that saps the
energy of incoming spells, substantially reducing their effectiveness
in the process. Whenever a combatant under the effects of Shell is
struck by Magical damage or Elemental damage reduced by M.
Armor, that damage is reduced by 50% after it has been modified
for M. ARM.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Debarrier

#### Shield
**Effect:** The combatant is fully enclosed by a glittering dome of
magical energy, essentially cutting them off from the general melee.
For as long as the Shield remains active, all damage done to the
combatant is automatically reduced to 0. All Status Conditions –
positive or negative – and Recovery effects, Items included, are
similarly nullified. Any preexisting Status Conditions are also
nullified.  
**Canceled by:** n/a

#### Status Immune
**Effect:** The combatant is temporarily immune to the effects of a
specific Status Condition or group of Status Conditions. Treat this as
if the combatant had an Immunity (I) to the Condition – or
Conditions – in question.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel

#### Wall
**Effect:** An invisible barrier of impenetrable force surrounds the
combatant, nullifying physical attacks. Whenever a combatant under
the effects of Wall is struck by Physical damage or Elemental
damage reduced by Armor, that damage is reduced to 0.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Debarrier

### Strengthen
Status Conditions that increase a combatant’s fighting potential and
equipment power.

#### Accelerate
**Effect:** The combatant moves with greater speed, covering ground at
a far more rapid pace. While under the effects of Accelerate, a
combatant’s SPD is doubled for purposes of calculating movement
rates; for purposes of Task Checks, the character’s Speed Rating is
increased by 25%.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Slow

#### Accuracy up
**Effect:** The combatant's blows land fast and true, bypassing shields,
dodges, and parrying attempts with equal ease. For as long as
Accuracy Up remains in effect, the combatant’s ACC is increased to
255.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel

#### Agility up
**Effect:** The combatant becomes more nimble, allowing them to strike
and dodge with greater ease. For as long as Agility Up remains in
effect, the combatant’s EVA and ACC are both increased by 25%.
The characters initiative score is increased by 2 when calculated at
the start of the round. For purposes of Task Checks, the character’s
AGI Rating is also increased by 25%.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Agility Down, Agility Break

#### Armor up
**Effect:** The combatant feels skin and armor harden, enhancing their
defensive capabilities. For as long as Armor Up remains in effect, the
combatant’s ARM rating is increased by 25%.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Armor Down, Armor Break

#### Aura
**Effect:** The combatant is surrounded by an invigorating golden glow.
For as long as Aura remains in effect, all Charge Times for Ability
Actions taken by the combatant are halved.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Curse

#### Blink
**Effect:** The combatant phases between solid and immaterial states at
random intervals, increasing their ability to escape attack. The
combatant’s EVA is increased by 20 for as long as Blink remains in
effect.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel

#### Critical up
**Effect:** The combatant's blows are drawn towards opponents' weak
spots, increasing the likelihood of a lucky hit in the right place. For
as long as Critical Up remains in effect, the combatant's CoS for
landing Critical Hits is at +100%. By default, this mean that Critical
Hits will occur on a 1 to 20 rather than a 1 to 10, though this effect
also stacks with Critical+, Critical++, and Signature Weapon.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel

#### Flight
**Effect:** The combatant gains the ability to move through air, traveling
over hindering environmental features almost effortlessly. While in
this state, the combatant can move over hazardous terrain – such
as lava flows and spiked floors – with no ill effects, and suffers no
movement modifiers for terrain. Combatants under the effects of
Flight cannot be reached by Melee effects; this Status Condition also
protects against certain other attacks, such as Quake.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Drag

#### Float
**Effect:** The combatant hovers a half-meter off the ground, seemingly
suspended on thin air. While in this state, the combatant can move
over hazardous terrain – such as lava flows and spiked floors – with
no ill effects, and suffers no movement modifiers for terrain.
However, movements become more difficult to control, making it
impossible to take Full-Move Actions. Float may also protect against
certain attacks and Abilities; if so, this will be noted in the relevant
description.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Drag

#### Haste
**Effect:** The combatant is surrounded by a red aura; when they move,
it is with such speed that they appear like a blur to the untrained
eye. Combatants affected by Haste double their Initiative scores
during the Initiative Phase when determining the order of combat,
and may gain additional Actions as a result of this – see the rules
on Extreme Initiative on page 4 for more details. If in a Scene where
no Initiative is generated, Haste bestows two Actions by default. For
purposes of Task Checks, the character’s SPD Rating is also
increased by 50%.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Slow

#### Magic Up
**Effect:** The combatant is imbued with a sudden surge of magical
energy, greatly increasing their spellcasting potential. All magical
attacks inflict +25% damage for as long as Magic Up remains in
effect.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Magic Down, Magic Break

#### Mental Up
**Effect:** The combatant becomes exceptionally strong-willed, granting
them superior protection against magic. For as long as Mental Up
remains in effect, the combatant’s M. ARM rating is increased by
25%. For purposes of Task Checks, the character’s MAG Rating is
also increased by 25%.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Mental Down, Mental Break

#### MP Half
**Effect:** The combatant is fortified with ambient magic, greatly
increasing their own mana reserves. For as long as MP Half remains
in effect, all Magic effects with an MP cost have their costs lowered
by 50%. Fira, for instance, would only cost 11, rather than 22 MP to
cast for a combatant under the effects of MP Half.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel

#### MP Quarter
**Effect:** The combatant's ability to channel magic is strengthened,
significantly reducing the amount of mana they must sacrifice to cast
magic. For as long as MP Quarter remains in effect, all Magic effects
with an MP cost have their costs lowered by 25%. Fira, for instance,
would only cost 17, rather than 22 MP to cast for a combatant under
the effects of MP Quarter.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel

#### Power Up
**Effect:** The combatant is imbibed with a sudden surge of physical

#### Regen
**Effect:** The combatant is surrounded by a green aura that slowly
begins to heal their injuries, regenerating accumulated damage over
time. Whilst under the effects of Regen, a combatant recovers an
amount of HP equivalent to 10% of their maximum HP score at the
beginning of each Status Phase.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel

#### Reraise
**Effect:** A golden halo of vital energy hovers over the target. If any
attack or other event should ever reduce a combatant under the
effects of Reraise to 0 or fewer HP, Reraise will immediately cast the
Spell Raise on them. The Status Condition automatically expires once
the target has been resurrected.  
**Canceled by:** Unconscious, Dispel

#### Ruse
**Effect:** The combatant is surrounded by mirror images, confounding
and confusing foes in equal measure. The combatant’s EVA is
increased by 40 for as long as Ruse remains in effect.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel

#### Spirit Up
**Effect:** The combatant is gifted with a burst of spiritual energy,
infusing their incantations and fortifying their mind against harmful
magics. For as long as Spirit Up remains in effect, the combatant’s
M. EVA and M. ACC ratings are both increased by 25%. For
purposes of Task Checks, the character’s SPR Rating is also
increased by 25%.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Spirit Down, Spirit Break

#### Vanish
**Effect:** The combatant is turned completely transparent, rendering
them invisible for all intents and purposes. Combatants affected by
Vanish may not be targeted by normal Attacks, Spells or Abilities,
though they will still take damage if the Group or Party they belong
to is targeted; attacks with the ‘All’ designation will also affect them.
Stealth rolls made while under the effects of Vanish gain a 50%
bonus; monsters using the Day Vision sense to detecting a target
under the effect of Vanish do so with a Conditional Modifier of -70.  
**Canceled by:** Dispel, Damage
