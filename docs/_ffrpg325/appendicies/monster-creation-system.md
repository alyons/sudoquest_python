title: "Monster Creation System"
---

The old adage maintains that good cannot exist without evil.
Nowhere is this more true than in the worlds of Final Fantasy,
where the road to one’s destiny is paved with the bones of evil,
ravening, and outright bizarre foes.  
Appendix II is home to the Monster Creation System (MCS), an indepth
toolkit for assembling monsters of all stripes. Whether great,
small, annoying, or outright world-threatening, the guides in this
Appendix allow you to create all of them with ease. Designing a
monster is not significantly different from designing a character;
both use a systematic step-by-step process which may seem
overwhelming at first, but will become increasingly familiar over
time. As with character creation, it may take a few attempts before
the process ‘clicks.' Because of this, you should take the time to
throw together a few practice monsters before creating opponents
for your players in earnest.  

## MONSTER PROFILE
Monster designs begin with a basic outline of the creature, called
its ‘profile.' Like a character’s background, the profile helps to
establish the monster’s ‘personality’ and basic characteristics
through ten separate headings: Category, Monster Family, Location,
Appearance, Size, Intelligence, Behavior, Frequency, Encounter Size,
Reaction, and Senses. Each of these ten will be explained in detail
over the next few pages.
### CATEGORY
Begin by selecting one or more of the fourteen Monster Categories
below. Aside from establishing what [Enemy Type] Killer Weapons
and Advantages harm your creature, the Category also offers a
broad template from which the finer details of the monster can be
worked out. Categories are not mutually exclusive; dual-category
monsters such as Demon/Beast, Machina/Aerial and
Dragon/Undead are all perfectly plausible. If the Category is not
immediately obvious, skip this step and come back once the
monster’s other characteristics have been determined.  
#### Abnormal
‘Generic’ monsters that fit in no other category, including unique or
one-of-a-kind creatures.  
Examples: Chimera, Presenter, Turtapod  
Recommended Abilities: Any  
#### Aerial
Monsters with the power to defy gravity, usually through wings, but
occasionally through more exotic means, such as inflated bladders,
gas sacs, or magic.  
Examples: Bats, Hell Divers, Zuus  
Recommended Abilities: Elemental Weakness (Wind), Move-Flight  
#### Amorph
Shapeless monsters with no discernible anatomy that are all but
impervious against conventional weapons. Some Amorphs may be
capable of shifting from one form to another.
Examples: Blobras, Flans  
Recommended Abilities: Heavy Armor  
#### Aquan
Water-dwelling monsters. Though usually only encountered in their
native element, they may occasionally venture onto dry land to
terrorize its denizens.  
Examples: Caribes, Sahagins, Sharks  
Recommended Abilities: Elemental Weakness (Lightning), Elemental
Resistance (Water), Move-Water  
#### Arcana
Monsters created of raw magic, typically as a result of a Spell.  
Examples: Bombs, Elementals, Summons  
Recommended Abilities: Any  
#### Beast
The ‘natural’ inhabitants of the world. Includes monstrous animals
and other fauna twisted by magic.  
Examples: Fangs, Mu, Snow Lions  
Recommended Abilities: Any  
#### Constructs
Lifeless constructs of stone, wood, or other material, animated by
magic or technology.  
Examples: Golems, Sol Cannons, Warmechs  
Recommended Abilities: Elemental Immunity (Bio), Drain Proof,
Status Immunity (Mystify), Status Immunity (Toxin), Status Immunity
(Transform).  
#### Dragon
Monstrous reptiles with a serpentine bent. Covers the classic
winged dragons as well as their groundbound relatives.  
Examples: Dragons, Hydras, Wyverns  
Recommended Abilities: Any  
#### Fiend
Supernatural opponents serving the cause of evil. Fiends are
generally highly adept with the use of magic.  
Examples: Ahrimans, Buers, Imps  
Recommended Abilities: Elemental Weakness (Holy), Elemental
Resistance (Shadow)  
#### Humanoid
Creatures of humanoid proportions and modest intelligence.  
Examples: Humans, Elves, Gigases, Gnolls, Goblins, Orcs, Yagudo  
Recommended Abilities: Elemental Weakness (Bio)  
#### Insect
Insects come in countless shapes and sizes, and are typically
protected by tough, chitinous shells.  
Examples: Antlions, Grand Mantises, Sand Scorpions  
Recommended Abilities: Elemental Weakness (Ice)  
#### Lizard
Reptiles who don’t readily fall into the ‘Dragon’ category. They
typically rely more on natural means of offense than magical ones.  
Examples: Anacondaurs, Basilisks  
Recommended Abilities: Elemental Weakness (Ice)  
#### Plant
Animated and mutated plant matter as well as natural hazards such
as carnivorous plants.  
Examples: Cactuars, Malboros, Ochu  
Recommended Abilities: Elemental Weakness (Fire)  
#### Undead
The living dead are creatures reanimated by foul sorcery or
supernatural circumstance.  
Examples: Ghosts, Skeletons, Zombies  
Recommended Abilities: Auto-Zombie, Elemental Weakness (Fire),
Elemental Weakness (Holy)  

>! Why Recommended?  
Anybody who’s had some familiarity with the Final Fantasy
games may wonder why Categories don’t have firmly defined
Abilities attached to them. In many of the e-games, certain
monster categories do have standardized weaknesses and
properties, but these are not consistent throughout the series.
Final Fantasy X, for instance, introduced Undead opponents
resistant to Fire, in stark contrast to previous games. For this
reason, idiosyncrasies typically found in given Monster
Categories are recommended rather than required.

### MONSTER FAMILY
A creature’s Monster Family acts as sub-category for the Monster
Category, and serves as a convenient way to group together
monsters with similar characteristics. If your monster is an entirely
new creation, the Monster Family will usually be named after it; if
you are just adding a monster to an existing Monster Family, use
the name already in place.

### LOCATION
Where the monster is most likely to be encountered; usually its
preferred habitat, or range of habitats. Basic concept and Category
will take most of the guesswork out of this – Aquan monsters will
be found in Rivers, Lakes, and Oceans, while Plants are more at
home in places like Jungles and Forests. The environment a
monster lives in also provides a starting point for assigning things
like Elemental Resistances and Immunities later on – obviously, a
glacier-dwelling monster is more likely to be able to brave Blizzard
Spells than one inhabiting a volcano. The thirteen types of Location
are:

**Desert:** Hot, arid, sandy regions.  
**Dungeons:** A catchall term for the towers and fortresses
inhabited by evil masterminds. Unlike ruins, dungeons are still in
active use, and are significantly nastier as a result.  
**Forests:** Dense temperate forests and woodlands made up of
timber trees. Not to be confused with jungles.  
**Hills:** Grassy or wooded highlands.  
**Jungles:** Hot and humid areas of tropical rainforest, with heavy
rainfall and even heavier vegetation.  
**Marshes:** Alternately known as swamps. Fetid wetlands notorious
for their muddy, unstable ground.  
**Mountains:** Rocky highlands characterized by sparser, tougher
vegetation and colder temperatures.  
**Plains:** Also called steppe or veldt. Typically large, unbroken
stretches of rolling grassland.  
**Oceans:** The open sea.  
**Rivers/Lakes:** Large, natural bodies of flowing or standing
freshwater located inland.  
**Ruins:** Disused and abandoned buildings or areas of habitation.
Unlike dungeons, ruins are claimed by nobody, and have fallen into
an advanced state of disrepair as a result.  
**Towns:** Areas of civilization Though the term ‘town’ is used, this
category applies to settlements of any size, from tiny hamlets to
large cities.  
**Tundra:** ‘Cold deserts' marked by sparse vegetation, periodic
snowfall and extreme temperatures.  
**Underground:** Caves, caverns, tunnels, mines, and any other
areas characterized by persistent lack of sunlight and cool, damp
environs.  

Like Categories, Locations are not mutually exclusive – a monster
can be found in two or more Locations if their physiology supports
it. If you are creating a monster for a campaign world, generic
Location types can be replaced with specific locations in that world.

### APPEARANCE
In short, what the monster looks like. Again, the Category will take
most of the guesswork out of this – Dragons will be vaguely
reptilian in appearance, Amorphs blobs and oozes, Machina tough
and composed of inorganic materials. Even within a type, however,
there’s tremendous potential for diversity. A dragon can just as
easily be a nine-headed monstrosity covered with golden scales or
a polychromatic serpent, have six wings, chitinous armor, or shining
feathers. Don’t be afraid to take a few risks and mix things up;
many of the most memorable creatures inhabiting the Final Fantasy
universe are ones that stray more than just a little from the norm.  
Habitat, too, plays a role in shaping appearance. Creatures living
in extreme heat or cold will typically have bodies adapted to these
conditions – shaggy fur and other natural insulation in the case of
cold-dwellers, heat-resistant and water-retaining features for those
making their homes in deserts. Remember that appearance is
primarily a visual calling card. A short, vivid set of details that stick
in your players’ minds long after the encounter ultimately will pay
greater dividends than a long-winded description cataloging the
size of every claw and talon.

### SIZE
The monster’s overall size measured in meters. More of a cosmetic
consideration than a practical one; whilst size does give some
indication as to the monster’s overall resilience and power, small
monsters are just as capable of dealing out grievous damage as
large ones, if not moreso.

### INTELLIGENCE
In the FFRPG, a character's intelligence is measured by their MAG
Attribute as well as their Lore* and Language* Skills. Because
monsters do not have Skills to fall back on, a monster's intellect is
instead summed up by an Intelligence rating. Pick one of the six
ratings below:

**None:** simply means the monster is not capable of independent
action or thought; monsters of this type rely entirely on another
monster or NPC for guidance. This kind of intelligence tends to be
characteristic of more primitive Machina and some types of
Undead.  
**Animal:** intelligence indicates a creature driven almost exclusively
by its instincts; their actions and aggressions are motivated more
by where their next meal is coming from than any kind of higher
purpose.  
**Primitive:** creatures display a spark of sentience, and may even be
capable of speaking an actual language, albeit reluctantly – a club
is always far more efficient at getting the message across.  
**Average:** intelligence puts a monster at roughly human level in
terms of reasoning capacity. Demi-human races such as Goblins
and Orcs fall under this category.  
**High:** intelligence usually designates mages and other scholars of
a particular species. They can match wits with almost any member
of the party, and have a more-than-fair chance of winning the
resulting battle of minds.    
Monsters with **Elder** intelligence are rare indeed, displaying the
kind of fierce intellect normally reserved for the wisest of Sages.
Such creatures usually have the benefit of centuries of learning
behind them, and may even be immortal.  

If it necessary to reflect monsters who are slightly above or below
average for their Intelligence rating – say, the difference between a
Goblin Mugger and a Goblin Mage – add a plus (+) or minus (-)
after the Intelligence rating. Obviously, a monster’s Intelligence will
also have a bearing on its strategy as well as its interactions with
the Party – see Reaction and Behavior below.

### REACTION
The monster’s Reaction gauges how the monster will react to the
players when the inevitable encounter takes place, and offers a
useful yardstick for how the encounter develops from there.
For FFRPG purposes, Reactions are broken up into categories. Pick
one of the four categories below:

**Friendly** monsters offer advice, directions, items, or healing,
depending on the circumstances. Some may expect compensation
for their troubles, while others help the party for free.  
**Neutral** monsters are passive, and will retaliate only if threatened
themselves. While they won’t go out of their way to help the players,
they won’t attempt to hinder them either. If not attacked or
otherwise intimidated and intelligent enough, they may be willing to
barter or offer their assistance in exchange for payment or some
other small favor.  
**Wary** monsters won’t pounce on the players outright, but it won’t
take much to provoke their ill-will. If they feel threatened by the
Party, they will almost certainly be the first to attack.  
**Hostile** monsters will attack PCs on sight, regardless of the
circumstances and odds. This may be for a wide variety of reasons,
ranging from territorial considerations to simple hunger.  

### BEHAVIOUR
Now we add a touch of color. A monster’s behavior can potentially
encompass everything from feeding and mating habits to social
mores – How do they react to potential threats? What do they feed
on? Do they travel in packs or alone? Do they attack ferociously or
strategically, letting the battle come to them?  
This section should also cover the monster’s strategies in
combat, if any. Magic-using monsters may prefer to cast debilitating
Spells like Poison or Sleep, or systematically target front-line
warriors with offensive magics, while their physical counterparts
might be more interested in going after that unprotected Mage or
bulking up their defenses via Mighty Guard. Others, such as the
Cactuar, may be inveterate cowards who run away at the first sign
of trouble – usually after making sure any possible pursuers are
thoroughly incapacitated.

### FREQUENCY
For the purpose of arranging random encounters and encounter
tables, the monster should be given a Frequency rating. This rating
simply determines how common the monster is in its native habitat.
There are five possible Frequency ratings: Common, Uncommon,
Rare, Very Rare and Unique. This last grade is usually reserved for
Boss monsters and their ilk, and means the monster will never be
encountered unless the encounter is premeditated by the GM.

### ENCOUNTER SIZE
In order to make it easier for GMs to plan encounters, monster
entries should have a recommended Encounter Size to show how
many monsters are needed to provide a reasonably challenging
encounter for a party of equivalent Level. Encounter Size is
expressed in terms of values like ‘1/5’ – the first number is the
recommended number of monsters and the second the number of
PCs needed to fight it. 1/6, for instance, means ‘one monster per
six characters if of equivalent Level.’ 2/1, on the other hand, reads
‘two monsters for every one character.' On average, a party will go
through four encounters before gaining a level, so encounter size
should be adjusted with that in mind.  
Note that these numbers are likely to be rough at best; even with
trial and error, the GM’s mileage may vary. For parties with
excessively powerful equipment and a healthy stock of recovery
items, even higher-level monsters won’t be as much of a challenge
as they should be, while cash-strapped groups will find the inverse
to be true. Job choice also affects encounter effectiveness. If a
monster is primary weak against physical attacks and the party
composed primarily of Mages, the resulting challenge will increase
exponentially. Aim for the middle ground and assume a mixed party
of physical and magical attackers; this gives a better margin of
error than skewing the numbers towards either extreme.

>! Mixing and Matching  
Encounter Size can be used to put together mixed encounters
composed of several different monster types. Assume that a
GM is setting up a battle for their four-strong party. The first
monster they pick, the Rock Hound, has an Encounter Size
rating of 2/1, meaning that the ‘balanced’ Group would
comprise eight Rock Hounds. However, for variety’s sake, the
GM also wants to include at least one additional monster type.
Looking through their notes, they find another 2/1 monster,
the Blade Guard. They could now opt to use any mix of Rock
Hounds and Blade Guards, up to a total of eight – four
Hounds and four Guards, six Guards and two Hounds, one
Guard and seven Hounds…  
But the GM also has a 1/2 monster, the Zombie Basilisk. If
they wanted to add a third monster to the mix, they could build
a Group out of one Zombie Basilisk, two Rock Hounds and two
Blade Guards. Alternatively, they could substitute another 1/2
monster in – the possibilities are literally endless.

### SENSES
Because FFRPG monsters have no Skills, they cannot use
Awareness to spot or track a party. Instead, they use Senses as a
substitute. Monsters have six total Senses at their disposal:

**Day Vision** is the default Sense for most monsters. If it is their
primary means of locating an opponent, they may have unusually
keen eyesight and the capacity to spot targets over long distances.  
**Night Vision** allows monsters to see opponents in dark or dim
lighting conditions with increased clarity.  
Monsters that detect based on **Sound** can either hear normal
sounds or – in the case of burrowing monsters – detect vibrations
created by movement.  
**Smell** is generally used by Beasts to track their prey. Because
scents left by a target usually last longer than other sensory cues,
monsters that rely heavily on this sense can be highly persistent
opponents.  
Undead monsters and some types of Fiend and Construct use a
**Life** Sense to ‘smell’ out living creatures. Because of this, they
usually have trouble locating artificial constructs.  
**Magic** sense is common amongst Arcana. In this case, the
monster can ‘see’ the aura given off by natural magic-users –
read: all Jobs with an MP die – as well as items imbued with magic,
including Accessories, Weapons and Armor with Equipment Abilities,
Battle Items, and Support Items.

When creating the monster, give each of these Senses a Rating
from 0 to 100. If a situation arises where one or more party
members are using Stealth to sneak by the monster, use the
highest-rated Sense in place of an Awareness Rating for the
Opposed Skill Test to see whether the monster notices. Conditional
Modifiers imposed on the characters sneaking by should be
appropriate to the monster's primary sense. Wearing camouflage
will do nothing to fool a creature using Life sense, for instance –
the only way to completely disguise yourself is to cast Zombie.

## ATTRIBUTES AND STATISTICS
Now that the background material is complete, the numbercrunching
begins in earnest. Every option given over the next few
pages has specific Gil and XP values attached to it. As you create
your monster, keep track of the modifiers listed for every choice
you make – these will be particularly important at the end of the
design process.

> ! Multiple Forms  
Monsters with multiple incarnations are a time-honored Final
Fantasy traditions, particularly for final battles; defeat one
form, and your opponent promptly shifts to another, even more
powerful one. There are two ways of representing this in the
FFPRG:
If a monster can change forms at will, assume that doing so
requires a standard Ability Action to carry out. Create each
‘alternate’ form as a separate monster, but do not generate
Hit Points and Magic Points for the alternate forms; they will
use the current and maximum HP and MP values of the ‘base’
form even after they change over.
Calculate the Gil and XP values for the ‘base’ form, then add
the Gil and XP values for every Ability and Attack used by an
alternate form but not present on the ‘base’ form. Once this
has been calculated, multiply both by 1.1; this is the final Gil
and XP value of the monster.
For monsters that shift forms only after the previous form
has been defeated in combat, treat each form as a completely
independent monster. The total Gil and XP value for the
monster will be equal to the sum of all of its incarnations’
values.

### TYPE
Begin by selecting a Type for the monster from the list below. This
will determine its overall power level as well as its full capabilities.

**Regular** monsters are cannon fodder, and should make up
around 75% of the opponents the Party runs into during the
course of their adventures. However, this does necessarily not
mean that the players will have an easy time with them.  
**Notorious** monsters are a step up, representing grizzled
veterans, favored minions, and one-of-a-kind creatures. Notorious
monsters are usually encountered at the end of every other
session; the average adventure will usually have several of these to
give the players grief. Unlike normal monsters, Notorious monsters
and their superiors can have quite developed personalities, and
should make for a memorable encounter if handled correctly.  
**Bosses** usually appear during an adventure's climax, and should
be constructed as a typically epic showdown requiring a good deal
of the Party’s resources and wit to overcome.  
**End Bosses** are the players’ most powerful archenemies. These
are typically only encountered after a series of adventures, if not
the end of a full-fledged campaign, and tend to be an integral part
of the game’s ongoing storyline.  
In game terms, Notorious, Boss, and End Boss monsters will have
significantly higher Hit Points and possess certain Abilities at no
additional cost. Several restrictions on attacks and attack modifiers
are also waived for monsters of this kind, allowing them to deal
significantly more damage to opponents. These are discussed in
more detail in the relevant sections further along. Once you have
chosen a Type, note down the Base XP and Gil Value given for it
below and continue.

| TYPE     | BASE XP VALUE |BASE GIL VALUE|
|:-------:|:----------:|:------------:|
|Regular  | 40         | 15           |
|Notorious| 100        | 25           |
|Boss     | 225        | 55           |
|End Boss | 350        | 90           |

### LEVEL
Once a Type has been chosen, the next consideration is the
monster’s Level. As with PCs, monsters have a Level from 1 to 99,
reflecting their overall experience and toughness. A higher Level
affects all of the monster’s abilities – it increases the number of
Attribute Points available to it, increases its Combat Statistics, and
improves the damage it can cause with each attack. It also
increases the number of Experience Points and Gil the monster is
worth if defeated in battle. As a rough rule of thumb, the higher the
Level, the harder – and more rewarding – the monster will be to
defeat.  
Under most circumstances, the monster’s Level will be equal to
the average Level of the Party it is intended for; a Level 28 Party,
for instance, will generally be best off facing monsters ranging from
Level 26 to Level 30. For an additional challenge, set the monster’s
Level 5 to 10 Levels above the Party’s average.

### ATTRIBUTES
Like characters, monsters have a total of six Attributes: Strength,
Vitality, Speed, Agility, Magic, and Spirit. Every monster has a total
of (35 + Level) Attribute Points to split between these six, raising
Attribute ratings at a rate of 1 Point per 1 point in the relevant
Attribute. The monster’s basic concept will have some bearing on
how these are allocated – small, fast monsters will have high SPD
and AGI, but low VIT and STR, while large, lumbering ones will be
just the opposite. All Attributes must have a minimum value of 1;
other than that, there are no restrictions on allocation.

### COMBAT STATISTICS
Barring one exception, monsters have the exact same Combat
Statistics PCs do. Where they differ is in the fashion in which they
are generated.

#### Hit Points
A monster’s Hit Points determine how much damage it can soak up
before being defeated. As a general rule of thumb, the larger and
tougher a monster is, the more HP it will have at its disposal. Unlike
Jobs, monsters have no Hit Die, but a fixed value called a Hit Base;
the higher the Hit Base, the higher the monster’s final HP value.
Select a Hit Base from the table below and note down the relevant
modifiers.

|BASE|EXAMPLE|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|Leaf Bunny|-16|-6|
|1.5|Goblin|-8|-3|
|2|Sergeant|0|0|
|4|Ochu|+18|+8|
|6|Behemoth|+40|+19|
|8|Tonberry|+60|+30|

Once the monster’s Hit Base has been decided on, use the
appropriate formula from the following list to calculate the
monster’s total HP:

|Type | HP Formula|
|-|-|
|Regular |(Hit Base x VIT x Level)|
|Notorious |(Hit Base x VIT x Level) x 2|
|Boss |(Hit Base x VIT x Level) x 4|
|End Boss| (Hit Base x VIT x Level) x 6|

#### Magic Points
Spellcasting Monsters will need at least some amount of MP to
power their magic; the more MP they have at their disposal, the
greater the power and extent of their spellcasting ability. Unlike the
Hit Base, a Magic Base is purely optional; if the monster has no
Spells to speak of, this step may be skipped entirely. Otherwise,
select a Magic Base from the table below and note down the
relevant modifiers.

|BASE|EXAMPLE|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| - |Leaf Bunny|0|0|
|0.5|Goblin|+8|+3|
|1|Black Mage|+15|+7|
|1.5|Dark Force|+22|+10|
|2|Black Waltz|+35|+16|
|4|Magic Master|+50|+28|

Provided the monster has been given a Magic Base, use the
appropriate formula from the following list to calculate the
monster’s total MP:

|Type | MP Formula|
|-|-|
|Regular| (Magic Base x SPR x Level)|
|Notorious| (Magic Base x SPR x Level) x 1.5|
|Boss| (Magic Base x SPR x Level) x 2|
|End Boss |(Magic Base x SPR x Level) x 3|

#### Accuracy
Accuracy serves the same purpose in monsters as it does in a
player character, determining how accurate the monster's Attacks
are. However, as the monster does not have a Weapon Skill, ACC is
the sole deciding factor in whether or not its attacks hit. Use the
following formula to calculate the monster’s ACC:
```
(80 + Level + (AGI x 2))
```

#### Magic Accuracy
The Magic Accuracy Combat Statistic works for monsters as it does
for players, determining the likelihood of the monster’s Spells
affecting their intended target. Use the following formula to
calculate the monster’s M. ACC:
```
(100 + Level + (MAG x 2))
```

#### Dexterity
Dexterity is used to determine the accuracy of certain attacks,
typically used in cases where the monster is inflicting a negative
status. Use the following formula to calculate the monster's DEX:
```
(50 + Level + (AGI x 2))
```

#### Mind
Mind is used to determine the accuracy of certain attacks, typically
used in cases where the monster is inflicting a negative status. Use
the following formula to calculate the monster's MND:
```
(50 + Level + (MAG x 2))
```

#### Armor
Unlike the players, monsters don’t wear individual pieces of
protective gear. For this reason, their Armor rating is measured by
a single overall value called the Armor Base. Monsters with a high
Armor Base are typically protected by shells, thickened hides or
outright sheets of metal, but may also sport a larger Armor Base
simply because they are difficult to damage with conventional
attacks – Amorphs are one example of this. Select an ARM Base
from the table below and note down the modifiers.

|BASE|EXAMPLE|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0.5|Leafer|-5|-2|
|1|Goblin|0|0|
|2|Dark Knight|+10|+5|
|4|Golem|+19|+9|
|6|Iron Giant|+26|+18|

Once the monster’s Armor Base has been decided on, use the
following formula to calculate the monster’s ARM:
```
(Armor Base x Level + (VIT / 2))
```

Generally speaking, monsters with a high ARM value should have
a comparatively low M. ARM, and vice versa.

#### Magic Armor
As with Armor, Magic Armor in monsters is based on a single value
– the monster’s Magic Armor Base – rather than many separate
pieces of armor. Select an Magic Armor Base from the table below
and note down the modifiers.

|BASE|EXAMPLE|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0.5|Goblin|-5|-2|
|1|Ghost|0|0|
|2|Black Mage|+10|+5|
|4|Dark Force|+19|+9|
|6|Magic Master|+26|+18|

Once the monster’s Magic Armor Base has been decided on, use
the following formula to calculate the monster’s M. ARM:
```
(Magic Armor Base x Level + (SPR/2))
```

Generally speaking, monsters with a high M. ARM value should
have a comparatively low ARM, and vice versa. Spellcasting
monsters will typically have a higher Magic Armor Base than those
who rely primarily on physical attacks.

#### Evasion
As with PCs, a monster’s Evasion value represents its ability to
dodge or intercept physical attacks. Use the following formula to
calculate the monster’s EVA:
```
(Level + SPD + AGI)
```

#### Magic Evasion
Magic Evasion represents the monster’s resistance to the players’
Spells and Status Conditions. Use the following formula to calculate
M. EVA:
```
(Level + MAG + SPR)
```

## ATTACKS
With the basic properties of the monster settled, it’s time to move
onto its offensive capabilities. Attacks are the first and simplest of
these; offensive, damage-dealing maneuvers carried out as Attack
Actions in combat, and are sealed by the Status Condition Disable.
Regardless of its range of abilities, every monster will have at least
one or two 'natural' melee attacks to fall back on, typically in the
form of a bite, punch, claw or horn. The exact form of the attack is
largely dependent on the monster’s type. A Human-type monster,
for instance, might have a sword or spear, whilst a Plant-type
monster would attack with thorns or vines.

### NAME THE ATTACK
Each attack has its own name for purposes of identification, usually
depending on what the monster does. A simple physical attack
could be called Swipe or Beak, for instance, while a more elaborate
one might have a name like Paean of the Heavens or Megiddo's
Flame. To help further establish a monster's personality, the
attack’s entry can include a short description of its visual effects,
such as ‘the monster lunges at the target, raking it with its talons.'

### DETERMINE ACTION TYPE
Now decide what kind of Action the attack is: Attack, Ability, or
Magic. This will determine which Status Condition seals the attack –
Disable will seal an Attack Action, Curse an Ability Action, and
Silence a Magic Action. In addition, only Attack Actions can score
Critical Hits, though this requires the monster to have the Critical
Attack Support Ability.

### DETERMINE ATTACK TYPE
Once the attack has been named and described, you must decide
what kind of attack it is. Select one of the options below and make
a note of the XP and Gil modifiers for your choice before
proceeding, keeping them separate from any other modifiers you
have been keeping track of.

#### Standard Attack
Effect: Standard attacks do damage and require you to select a
Damage Die – d6, d8, d10 or d12. The higher the Damage Die, the
more powerful the monster’s attack will be. When choosing which
Die to use, it may help to consider the size and purpose of the
monster. A large, physically oriented monster like an Iron Giant is
more likely to be a d10 or d12 than a Flan that only attacks with its
tendrils when its spellcasting abilities aren't doing the trick.

#### No Damage
Effect: Attacks that deal no damage are usually used for Charge
Breakers, Dispel Attacks, Near-Fatal Attacks, or Status Attacks –
see below for more details.

### DETERMINE TARGET
Now determine the attack's target by selecting the appropriate
options from the list below. Note down the relevant modifiers with
the attack's basic XP and Gil costs.

#### Single
Effect: The attack can only target a single combatant.

|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|

#### Group
Effect: The attack can target a Group of combatants.

|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|:-:|:-:|
|x2|x2|

#### Random Target
Effect: Random Target is not a standalone choice, but must be
combined with one of the other options listed here. If used in
conjunction with Single, the attack targets a random opponent by
default. If used in conjunction with Group, the attack strikes the
targeted Group a number of times equal to the number of active
combatants in that Group, targeting a random member every time.
If combined with Unfocused, an attack with Random Target hits one
randomly-determined combatant on the battlefield.

|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|:-:|:-:|
|x0.75|0.75|

#### Unfocused
Effect: The monster’s Attack damages everything on the battlefield,
changing its Target from Single to All. Pricing for an Unfocused
Attack depends on whether or not a monster is immune to its
effects. For instance, an Unfocused attack inflicting Sleep would
incur the x 2/x 2 modifier if the monster had Status Immunity (Seal)
or Status Immunity (Sleep).

|TYPE|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|:-|:-:|:-:|
|Vulnerable to attack|x1|x1|
|Immune to attack|x2|x2|

### ADD MODIFIERS
A Modifier is a special property attached to a basic attack to
enhance its effects. Any number of Modifiers can be added to an
attack; a handful have been given below, though the GM is at liberty
to add and price their own if needed. Not every Modifier will apply
to every attack type – attacks that do no damage cannot benefit
from Modifiers that involve damage in their effects. Be sure and
note down the XP and Gil modifiers of any properties added to the
Attack before proceeding to the next step.

#### Auto-Hit
Effect: The attack is precise enough that no ACC or M. ACC roll is
needed to see if it hits, though it may still be affected by Reaction
Abilities such as Evade & Counter. Any Modifiers attached to the
attack must still be rolled for as normal.

|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|:-:|:-:|
|x2|x2|

#### Charge Breaker
Effect: The monster has the ability to interrupt its opponents’
attacks with its own. If used against an opponent in the process of
executing a Slow Action – or any other Action with a Charge Time –
an attack with the Charge Breaker Modifier automatically cancels
the Action; the target is instead considered to be in a Defense
Action once the attack’s effects have been resolved, and will remain
in a Defense Action until it can choose its next Action.

|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|:-:|:-:|
|+18|+10|

#### Countdown
Effect: The monster’s attack takes a number of Rounds – 1 to 6 –
to execute, usually as a result of requiring a significant amount of
power to be built up and released. For all intents and purposes,
treat this as a specialized Charge Time – the same considerations
given to interrupting Slow Actions in Chapter 7 also apply here. An
Attack with Countdown usually gives its victims some kind of visual
signifier at the start of each Round to let them know where the
countdown is currently at. XP and Gil values are static regardless of
how long the Countdown takes, though every Round spent charging
the attack increases its final damage by 25%.

|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|:-:|:-:|
|x0.8|x0.8|

#### Delta Attack
Effect: The attack requires several sources of power to execute.
Designate Slave Parts or any number of other monsters when
selecting this Modifier – all of these must be active combatants on
the battlefield in order for the Delta Attack to be used. Only the
monster initiating the Delta Attack needs to have the attack and
Modifier, and requires just one Action to carry it out; anybody else
participating in it is just pouring additional energy into it, and does
not have to spend any Actions to do so. Delta Attack's XP and Gil
modifiers depend on whether one or several additional combatants
needed to execute the Attack.

|REQUIRED|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|
|-|-|-|
|One Part/Monster|x 0.75|x 0.75|
|Multiple Parts/Monsters|x 0.5|x 0.5|

#### Delay Attack
Effect: The attack has a limited CoS of reducing the target's
Initiative by a certain amount. This CoS will be determined later in
the attack's creation process. XP and Gil values are determined by
how much the target's Initiative is reduced by if Delay Attack is
successful.

|INITIATIVE LOST|XP MODIFIER|GIL MODIFIER|

#### Delay Strike
Effect: The attack has a CoS of 60% of reducing the target's
Initiative by a certain amount. XP and Gil values are determined by
how much the target's Initiative is reduced by if Delay Strike is
successful.

Effect: The attack has a CoS of 30% of reducing the target's
Initiative by a certain amount. XP and Gil values are determined by
how much the target's Initiative is reduced by if Delay Touch is
successful.

Barrier-type Status Conditions save Shield from the target. This CoS
will be determined later in the attack's creation process.

Elemental Affinity
Effect: The attack has an affinity towards one of the nine Combat
Elements, and counts as inflicting damage of that Element for
purposes of Weaknesses, Resistances, Immunities, Absorbances,
and any other situation where the Attack’s Element would have an
impact.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER

Ground Based
Effect: The Attack travels along – or through – the ground, limiting
its effectiveness against flying opponents. As a result, combatants
under the effects of the Status Conditions Float and Flight are
immune to its effects.

x 0.8 x 0.8
HP Drain
Effect: In addition to inflicting damage, the monster’s attack
restores the monster’s Hit Points by an amount equal to 50% of
the damage done after modifying for ARM or M. ARM. Thus, an HP
Drain attack that inflicts 150 damage will restore 75 HP to the
monster. HP Drain cannot be combined with HP Siphon.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
x 1.25 x 1.25
HP Siphon
Effect: In addition to inflicting damage, the monster’s attack
restores the monster’s Hit Points by an amount equal to the
damage done after modifying for ARM or M. ARM. Thus, an HP
Siphon attack that inflicts 150 damage will restore 150 HP to the
monster. HP Siphon cannot be combined with HP Drain, and should
not be combined with Power Strike unless the monster is of Boss
level or higher.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER

Effect: The monster’s attack ignores even the toughest armor.
Neither ARM nor M. ARM are applied when calculating damage for a
Melting attack.

MP Cost
Effect: The monster must spend Magic Points to use this attack. The
attack's MP cost is equal to:
(Attack's XP Value before MP Cost / 2) + Monster Level
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
x 0.75 x 0.75
MP Damage
Effect: Rather than inflict physical damage, the attack affects its
target’s mana reserves instead. Upon a successful strike, the target
loses a number of Magic Points equal to the damage inflicted by the
attack; no other damage is done.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
x 1.25 x 1.25
MP Drain
Effect: The monster’s attack damages the target’s mana. All
damage dealt by an MP Drain attack – after modifying for ARM or
M. ARM as normal – is subtracted from the target’s Magic Points
rather than Hit Points, restoring 50% of that MP to the monster.
Thus, an MP Drain attack that inflicts 150 damage to the target's
MP would restore the monster's MP by 75 points. This Modifier
cannot be combined with the MP Siphon.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
x 1.5 x 1.4
MP Siphon
Effect: The monster’s attack damages the target’s mana. All
damage dealt by an MP Siphon attack – after modifying for ARM or
M. ARM as normal – is subtracted from the target’s Magic Points
rather than Hit Points, restoring an equal quantity of MP to the
monster. Thus, an MP Siphon attack that inflicts 150 damage to the
target's MP would restore the monster's MP by 150 points. This
Modifier cannot be combined with MP Drain, and should not be
used in conjunction with the Power Strike or Group Modifiers unless
the monster is a Boss or End Boss.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
x 1.75 x 1.6
Near-Fatal Attack
Effect: Near-Fatal Attack has a limited CoS of reducing a target to 1
HP regardless of its current HP, ARM or M. ARM values, or the
Damage Cap. This CoS will be determined later in the attack's
creation process. It is generally recommended that Near-Fatal
Modifiers be reserved for Boss monsters and above, and combined
with as few other Modifiers as possible.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+46 +22
Near-Fatal Strike
Effect: Near-Fatal Touch has a CoS of 60% of reducing a target to
1 HP regardless of its current HP, ARM or M. ARM values, or the
Damage Cap. It is generally recommended that Near-Fatal Modifiers
be reserved for Boss monsters and above, and combined with as
few other Modifiers as possible.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+49 +25
Near-Fatal Touch
Effect: Near-Fatal Touch has a CoS of 30% of reducing a target to
1 HP regardless of its current HP, ARM or M. ARM values, or the
Damage Cap. It is generally recommended that Near-Fatal Modifiers
be reserved for Boss monsters and above, and combined with as
few other Modifiers as possible.

Effect: The monster’s attack is capable of piercing reinforced armor.
Only 50% of the target’s ARM and M. ARM is applied when
calculating damage for a Piercing attack.

Power Strike
Effect: The monster’s attack strikes with unusual power. When
calculating the damage inflicted by a Power Strike attack, increase
the Damage Scale by (2 + (Monster’s Level / 10)). For balance
reasons, Power Strike should not be combined with Group or
Unfocused unless the monster is of Boss level or higher.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER

Effect: Not all monsters confine themselves to melee. With
projectiles like rocks, arrows, energy balls or even saliva, a monster
with a Ranged attack can hit opponents even at a distance.

x 1.1 x 1.1
Slow
Effect: The attack requires additional time to prepare, resulting in a
Charge Time. Charge Time is equal to (Monster’s Level / 4); a Level
40 monster with a Slow attack would thus have a CT of 10. The
lowest CT a Slow attack can have is 2; round up to compensate if
necessary.

after modifying for ARM – is subtracted from the target’s HP; the
remaining 50% is subtracted from its MP.

Status Attack
Effect: The monster’s attack has a limited CoS of inflicting a harmful

the attack's creation process. XP and Gil modifiers depend on the
actual Condition inflicted; for purposes of calculating these values,
Status Conditions are organized into one of four ‘classes.'
Class I: Berserk (4), Blind (4), Curse (4), Disable (4), Immobilize

DETERMINE ATTRIBUTE
Once all Modifiers have been added, decide which Attribute the
attack uses for damage codes – STR, AGI, or MAG. STR is typically
used by Physical melee attacks, AGI by Physical ranged attacks, and
MAG for Magical ones. Attacks that deal no damage can skip this
step.
SELECT DAMAGE TYPE
Decide whether the attack deals Physical or Magical damage. This
determines whether the attack is reduced by ARM or M. ARM.
Attacks that deal no damage can skip this step.
CALCULATE DAMAGE
The next step is to start pinning down the hard numbers. If the
attack deals damage, consult Table AII-1 and note down the
appropriate Damage Code for the monster's Level and Damage Die.
Once this is done, precalculate the damage by factoring in the
Attribute you chose for the attack at the beginning of the design
process. Assuming the attack doesn't have the Melting Modifier,
finish your calculations by writing out the full Damage Code, noting
whether the attack is modified by ARM or M. ARM. A Level 12
monster's MAG-based d8 attack would thus has a final Damage
Code of (3 x MAG) + d8, M. Armor.

### DETERMINE CHANCE OF SUCCESS

With damage settled, the last bit of numbercrunching involves
creating the attack's Chance of Success. Start by choosing which
Combat Statistic determines the basic CoS: Accuracy, M. Accuracy,
Mind, or Dexterity. Then decide what modifies the CoS: Evasion or M.
Evasion. In general, Accuracy and Dexterity are modified by Evasion
and M. Accuracy and Mind by M. Evasion, though there are
exceptions.  
Near-Fatal Attacks, Dispel Attacks, and Status Attacks also require
you to create a Chance of Success formula. In this case, the basic
CoS will be either (M. ACC - 50), Mind, or Dexterity, and can be
modified by Evasion or M. Evasion. Once you have chosen the
appropriate Combat Statistics, write out the Chance of Success
formula in the attack's description.

### FINAL TOUCHES

If the attack is Magical, you should also determine whether it is
affected by Reflect or the Ability Runic. An attack will only be
vulnerable to Runic if it has an MP Cost; the same criterion is
recommended for deciding whether or not Reflect works on the
attack.

### CALCULATE TOTAL PRICE

Once the Attack has been finished, you must figure out how much it
will adjust the monster's final Gil and XP values by. Check the XP
modifiers you wrote down, then add all numbers that aren't prefaced
by an 'x' together. Then multiply this total by every modifier prefaced
by an 'x,' one at a time. For example, if a Goblin has a Ground-
Based d6 attack with Group and Status Touch (Blind), the attack's
XP modifier is `(8 + 10) x 2 x 0.8, or 28`. Repeat this process for the
Gil modifiers, and you will have the final Gil and XP modifiers for the
attack.

### SAMPLE ATTACKS

Here are a few sample attacks put together with this system. The
monster's Level is given to the right of the attack name.

Magnitude 8 level 35
Target: Group Type: Magic Action (95 MP)
The ground begins to shudder as a violent quake tears through the
immediate area, showering the battlefield with fragments of rock and
earth. Magnitude 8 has a CoS of M. Accuracy, M. Evasion of inflicting
(10 x MAG) + d12, M. ARM Earth Elemental damage.
XP Modifier: 90 Gil Modifier: 30
Modifiers: Elemental Affinity, Group, MP Cost

Saliva level 40
Target: Single Type: Fast Ability
The monster spits a wad of magically charged saliva at an opponent,
miring them in gunk. Saliva inflicts (8 x MAG) + 3d6, M. ARM Magical
damage, striking automatically. In addition, Saliva has a CoS of 60%
of inflicting the Status Condition Curse (4). This attack is only gained
once the monster is reduced to 25% of its maximum Hit Points.
XP Modifier: 194 Gil Modifier: 64
Modifiers: SOS-Gain, Status Strike (Class I), Auto-Hit

Sonic Fangs level 20
Target: Single Type: Attack Action
The monster delivers a high-speed bite attack, repeatedly gnashing
at the target for massive damage. Sonic Fangs has a CoS of
Accuracy, Evasion of inflicting (11 x STR) + d10, (ARM / 2) Physical
damage.
XP Modifier: 97 Gil Modifier: 32
Modifiers: Piercing, Power Strike

## ACTION ABILITIES

Action Abilities fill in the cracks between attacks, Spells, and Job
Abilities, covering special techniques and capabilities that don't have
counterparts anywhere else. Unless otherwise specified, all Abilities
are Single target, require an Ability Action to use, and are sealed by
the Status Condition Curse.
NAME THE ABILITY
Like Attacks, Abilities are given descriptive names for identification
purposes. Unlike Attacks, however, many of the Action Ability effects
given here – such as Clone, Alarm, and Restore – are ‘complete
packages' rather than individual components. For this reason, it may
be easier to just keep the default name.
SELECT EFFECTS
Listed below are a number of basic templates for Action Abilities.
Select one to set the Ability’s mechanical effects.
Add Status
Effect: The monster can use an Ability Action to automatically add a
positive Status Condition (4) to a Single target. XP and Gil values are
given per Status added, and depend on the exact Status taken:
Class I: Float, Agility Up, Spirit Up, [Element] Spikes
Class II: Protect, Shell, Armor Up, Mental Up
Class III: Haste, Reflect, Power Up, Magic Up
Class IV: Regen, Aura, Vanish
Add Status can be used to add more than one Status Condition at
a time, though it is recommended that this option be reserved for
Boss monsters and creatures of Level 30 or above.
TYPE XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
Class I +14 +4
Class II +18 +6
Class III +26 +9
Class IV +38 +12
Alarm
Effect: The monster can use an Ability Action to summon an
additional monster into battle. The new monster arrives on the
battlefield at the beginning of the following Round, forming a Group
with the original monster, and generates Initiative as normal. Once
used, Alarm cannot be used again until the summoned monster has
been defeated or incapacitated.
The type of monster summoned by Alarm should be noted in the
Ability’s description. Multiple monsters can be summoned through a
single Alarm; in this case, multiply the XP and Gil Modifiers given
below by the number of monsters summoned. It is generally
recommended that any monsters summoned through Alarm be of
equal or lower Level to the monster doing the summoning.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+32 +18
Cannibalize
Effect: The monster can consume other monsters to increase its own
strength. A monster can Cannibalize a Single ally of a Level no
higher than (Monster's Level / 2) at the cost of one Ability Action.
This automatically reduces the target's HP to 0 – treat this as an
Eject-type effect.
XP and Gil values for Cannibalize depend on what effects it has. By
default, the monster regains (Target's Current HP) Hit Points, but
Cannibalize can instead bestow one positive Status Condition (4) on
the monster. XP and Gil values are given per Status added, and
depend on the exact Status taken:
Class I: Float, Agility Up, Spirit Up, [Element] Spikes
Class II: Protect, Shell, Armor Up, Mental Up
Class III: Haste, Reflect, Power Up, Magic Up
Class IV: Regen, Aura, Vanish
Monsters destroyed by Cannibalize reward XP and Gil as if they
had targeted by an Eject effect, though they only will do so once the
monster that Cannibalized them is defeated.
EFFECT XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
Regain HP +36 +12
Add Class I Status +10 +3
Add Class II Status +15 +5
Add Class III Status +22 +8
Add Class IV Status +32 +11
Clone
Effect: The monster can use an Ability Action to create a copy of one
of its opponents to act as an active combatant in the current battle.
The clone has all the Attributes, Combat Statistics, Equipment, and
Abilities of the original character, and generates Initiative as normal,
fighting on the monster’s behalf until killed or incapacitated. No XP
or Gil is awarded for defeating opponents created by Clone.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+64 +32
Escape
Effect: The monster has the ability to make Escape Actions, allowing
it to flee from battle. Monsters that successfully escape are not
counted as defeated, and award no XP, Gil, or Items to the players.
Escape is sealed by the Status Condition Immobilize.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+5 +2
Imprison
Effect: The monster is capable of seizing and imprisoning opponents
in battle. Doing so requires the monster to use an Ability Action.
Whilst imprisoned, the prisoner is afflicted with the Status Condition
Immobilize – even if he would normally be Immune to it – and
suffers 50% of any damage done to the monster after it has been
modified for ARM or M. ARM. The prisoner's ARM and M. ARM can be
used to further reduce this damage.
By default, the prisoner is only released if the monster decides to
let him go – this is done during the Status Phase, and costs no
Actions to do – or if the monster is incapacitated. However, Imprison
has a number of special Modifiers that can be added to give it more
strategic depth.
A Binding Prison prevents the captured target from making
Actions or generating Initiative for as long as he remains in the
monster’s clutches.
An Insecure Prison gives the target the opportunity to make an
Escape Action. The opposed roll for the Escape Action uses
(Monster's AGI + Monster's Level) instead of the monster's SPD
Rating.
A Sheltered Prison prevents the captured target from taking
damage when the monster is damaged in battle.
A target in a Damaging Prison loses 10% of his maximum Hit
Points at the end of every Status Phase he still remains imprisoned
for.
A Vulnerable Prison releases the target released from the
monster’s clutches once the monster suffers damage equal to 10%
of the monster’s maximum Hit Points. This damage is cumulative,
and does not have to be done in one attack.
These Modifiers may be combined as the GM chooses. The XP and
Gil modifiers given for each option come on top of the basic cost for
Imprison.

Item Use
Effect: The monster can make Item Actions, and has an Inventory of
its own. Items made available to a monster via its Inventory are
separate from the monster’s Treasure Tables; anything still left in the
monster’s Inventory when it is defeated is awarded to the players
alongside the usual treasure. Successful use of Steal liberates a
random item from the monster’s Inventory until there is nothing left
to steal; at this point, subsequent uses of Steal take items from the
Treasure Table as normal. Item Use is sealed by the Status Condition
Disable.

Restore
Effect: The monster has the ability to regenerate even grievous
damage. Through the use of an Ability Action, a monster with
Restore can regenerate 25%, 50%, or 75% of its maximum Hit
Points. Creatures under the Status Condition Zombie suffer the
appropriate amount of damage instead.
HP RESTORED XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
25% +20 +13
50% +60 +40

Steal Status
Effect: The monster is capable of stealing Status Conditions from
another combatant. Steal Status requires an Ability Action to carry
out, and transfers the newest Status Condition added to the target
to the monster, duration included, canceling it on the target in the
process. XP and Gil values depend on whether the monster will steal
any Status Condition, or only the newest positive Status Condition
added to the target. Steal Status may take multiple Status Conditions
with just one Action; in this case, multiply the values given below by
the maximum number of Status Conditions Steal Status can take.
When dealing with Auto- or SOS- Status Conditions, Steal Status
will add the Status Condition in question to the monster without
canceling the original; Status Conditions stolen in this manner
automatically have a Timer of (4).

SELECT MODIFIERS
Several of the Action Abilities above can be combined in with the
Modifiers given earlier on. These are: Delta Attack, Countdown, MP
Cost, Slow, SOS-Gain, SOS-Lose, and Unsealable. If you add a
Modifier, make a note of the XP and Gil modifiers listed.
CALCULATE TOTAL PRICE
Once any and all Modifiers have been assigned, total up all of the Gil
and XP modifiers incurred during the process of assembling the
Ability, then apply them to the Ability’s basic XP and Gil costs. Always
add all the values before multiplying the remainder. For example, if a
Controller has a Clone Ability with the Countdown and MP Cost
modifiers, its XP value is (64 x 0.75) x 0.75, or 36. Once this is
done, note down the final value of the Ability.
! New Abilities
While the MCS aims to be comprehensive, there is still plenty
of room to add more options. If you want to create a new
Ability, look at the cost of comparable effects to develop a
rough baseline for pricing it; if it is more powerful than one
Ability but less powerful than another, the best place to pitch
the price is somewhere in between the two ‘yardsticks’.
SPELLS
The PCs aren’t the only ones capable of wielding magic. Indeed,
spellcasting monsters are commonplace in many worlds, though
attack magic among monsters is more akin to an unconscious reflex
than studied magery.
In the FFRPG, a monster with magical capabilities can cast Spells
from the Black, Blue, Red, Time, White, and Call lists. A monster’s
spellcasting ability is considered a Magic Ability, and can be sealed
through use of the Status Condition Silence as normal. Each Spell
has its own XP and Gil modifiers based on Spell Level or MP cost;
the modifiers for a monster's spellcasting ability are equal to the
sum of all Spells it can cast.
SPELL XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
Level 1 +8 +5
Level 2 +15 +9
Level 3 +25 +14
Level 4 +33 +21
Level 5 +45 +30

Blue (41 - 54 MP) +45 +30
Blue (55 - 67 MP) +55 +37
Blue (68 - 84 MP) +64 +44
Blue (85+ MP) +80 +55
Call (1 - 25 MP) +27 +14
Call (26 - 60 MP) +42 +29
Call (61 - 100 MP) +64 +44
Call (101+ MP) +88 +59
Giving a monster the ability to cast Holy, Flare and Meteor – three
Level 8 Spells – would thus incur XP and Gil modifiers +240 and
+165 respectively. Note that unlike Mages, monsters are not
required to purchase a Spell’s prerequisites in order to obtain the
Spell itself, nor are they bound by any other restrictions; Black, White
and Time Spells may be freely mixed with one another. Spells,
however, are bought as-is, and cannot be combined with Modifiers.
One thing to keep in mind when purchasing magic is the fact that
monsters have significantly higher Hit Point values than a
comparative PC. Because of this, a Spell that causes a respectable
amount of damage against a monster will usually annihilate a PC in
one shot. One way to regulate this is to slow monsters’ Spell
progression, giving them higher-level magic like Blizzaga 7 to 10
Levels after the PCs have obtained it; the other is to keep monsters’
MAG scores low.
JOB ABILITIES
Monsters can also be given Job Abilities from the Ability Sets in
Chapter 4, though such additions need to be carefully weighed –
damage-dealing Abilities in particular can decimate a Party if
carelessly chosen. To keep these problems in bounds, monsters
should obtain Abilities 10 to 20 Levels after the PCs would normally
have access to them. In addition, it may help to keep monsters'
damage-determining Attributes relatively low.
Job Abilities are bought ‘as-is,' and cannot be combined with
Modifiers. Any Ability based on an Attack Action uses the monster’s
weakest Attack Action as a basis for damage; for Abilities that use
Expertise, use the monster's M. ACC - 50 instead.
Each Ability added has its own XP and Gil modifiers based on the
Level at which the Ability would normally be acquired by a PC.
Abilities may be freely mixed and matched from several Ability Sets,
though this may result in combinations many times more powerful
than their basic Level would indicated. Pricing in this case can be
adjusted as needed, as Level alone is not always a reliable indicator
of overall power.

Level 55 – 61 +78 +28
Level 62+ +86 +31
MOVEMENT ABILITIES
Movement Abilities govern how a monster moves in combat. Most
monsters will only have one Movement Ability, usually Move-Ground;
some may combine multiple forms of movement, giving them greater
versatility – and nuisance value.
Monsters with multiple movement types can switch between them
at the cost of an Action in combat, a fact that means they can be
combined with the SOS-Lose, SOS-Gain, and MP Cost Modifiers
presented earlier. If Modifiers are applied, change the Movement
Ability's XP and Gil modifiers accordingly.
Move-Burrow
Effect: The monster tunnels through the earth, although it may not
be capable of attacking until it surfaces. Burrowing monsters ignore
all terrain modifiers unless attempting to tunnel through water; in
this case, normal modifiers are applied. While burrowing, a
monster’s EVA, ARM, and M. ARM values are at +100%.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+60 +20
Move-Flight
The monster is capable of flying, and is treated as if afflicted with a
permanent Flight effect. Unlike the Status Condition of the same
name, this Flight may not be dispelled or otherwise removed during
the course of the battle, except through the use of effects like the
Time Magic Spell Drag.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+20 9
Move-Float
Effect: The monster levitates, hovering up to one meter off the
ground as if afflicted with a permanent Float effect. Unlike the Status
Condition of the same name, this Float may not be dispelled or
otherwise removed during the course of the battle, except through
the use of effects like the Time Magic Spell Drag.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER

Move-Ground
Effect: The monster has the ability to move on land. Standard
Movement Ability for most monsters.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
--- ---
Move-Teleport
Effect: The monster is capable of displacing itself through space,
moving from one location to the next in the blink of an eye. While this
has no effect on a monster's movement range, it does confer two
important advantages. Firstly, if the monster is targeted by a Singletarget
Slow Action and teleports before it goes off, the Action has no
effect – the monster is assumed to have relocated far enough away
to avoid any ill effects. Secondly, the monster's SPD Rating is
doubled when the players roll to Escape, making it significantly
harder to run from. As it is a natural ability rather than a Spell,
Move-Teleport cannot be sealed through the use of Status
Conditions.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+60 +40
Move-Water
Effect: A monster with Move-Water is be able to effectively drift, float,
and swim in a submarine environment, ignoring all penalties for
moving through Shallow and Deep Water as well as being able to act
Underwater without penalties. However, without the Move-Ground
Movement Ability, they cannot venture onto dry land.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER

SUPPORT ABILITIES
A monster’s Support Abilities confer specific benefits and properties
without the need to spend an Action to activate them. Notorious
monsters gain the Support Abilities Status Immunity (Death) and
Status Immunity (Condemn) at no additional XP or Gil cost; Boss and
End Boss monsters the Support Ability Status Immunity (Fatal).
Support Abilities cannot be sealed and can only be combined with
the SOS-Gain and SOS-Lose Modifiers.
Auto-Status
Effect: The monster is permanently under the effects of a certain
Status Condition, and begins the battle with that Condition active.
This Condition can be removed through the use of Spells or Abilities
such as Dispel; but will be re-added during the next Status Phase
and only fully cancelled once the monster is defeated. Auto-Status
can be taken in conjunction with both positive and negative Status
Conditions. XP and Gil values depend on the exact Status being
taken:
Class I Positive: Float, Agility Up, Spirit Up, [Element] Spikes
Class II Positive: Protect, Shell, Armor Up, Mental Up
Class III Positive: Haste, Reflect, Power Up, Magic Up
Class IV Positive: Regen, Aura, Vanish
Class I Negative: Berserk, Blind, Poison, Sleep, Slow, Zombie
Class II Negative: Confuse, Sap, Unaware
Class III Negative: Mini, Toad, Venom
Class IV Negative: Condemn, Petrify

Class III Negative -44 -15
Class IV Negative -64 -21
Bad Scan
Effect: If analyzed via the Scan Spell, the Equipment Ability Sensor,
or any similar effect, the monster will return incorrect information
intended to mislead the Party. How the Scan is ‘tampered’ with is left
to the designer to decide, but should be noted in the monster’s
writeup – one of the more obvious uses would have the monster
register as having a Weakness to an Element they in fact Absorb, or
vice versa, though there are other possibilities. Useless or not,
scanning the monster still costs MP or Actions as usual.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+14 +7
Can't Scan
Effect: The monster cannot be analyzed by means of the Scan Spell,
the Equipment Ability Sensor, or any similar effect. Any attempts to
do so cost Actions and MP as usual, but return no useful
information.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+10 +4
Comeback
Effect: The monster cannot be killed by normal means. Attacks can
damage and even incapacitate it, but it is only a matter of time
before the fell beast is back on its feet and ready for more action. If
reduced to 0 or fewer HP in battle, a monster with Comeback is
incapacitated as normal, but begins regenerating damage
immediately. After a certain number of Rounds, regeneration is
complete, and the monster comes back into the battle with 100% of
its Hit Points and Magic Points restored. Comeback’s XP and Gil
values depend on the number of Rounds the monster needs to
regenerate.
COMEBACK DELAY XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
2 Rounds +50 +18
4 Rounds +37 +14
6 Rounds +25 +9
Critical Attack
Effect: By default, monsters' Attack Actions cannot land Critical Hits
in combat. A monster with Critical Attack, however, is no longer
subject to his restriction. Critical Attack’s XP and Gil values depend
on the likelihood of a Critical Hit being landed.
CRITICAL RANGE XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
Standard (1 - 10) +8 +3
Critical+ (1 - 20) +13 +5
Critical++ (1 - 30) +18 +7
Elemental Absorbance
Effect: The monster has an extremely strong affinity towards one or
more of the nine Combat Elements, and is considered to have an
Absorbance to it. Select which Element Elemental Absorbance
applies to when taking this Ability. Elemental Absorbance cannot be
taken in conjunction with a Weakness, Resistance, or Immunity for
the same Element. XP and Gil modifiers are given per Element –
having Absorbance towards Wind and Earth would carry a combined
modifier of +66/+30.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+33 +15
Elemental Immunity
Effect: The monster has a strong affinity towards one or more of the
nine Combat Elements, and is considered to have an Immunity to it.
Select which Element Elemental Immunity applies to when taking this
Ability. Elemental Immunity cannot be taken in conjunction with a
Weakness, Resistance, or Absorbance for the same Element. XP and
Gil modifiers are given per Element – having Immunity towards Wind
and Earth would carry a combined modifier of +30/+14.
XP MODIFIER GIL MODIFIER
+15 +7
Elemental Potency
Effect: The monster's elemental attacks are more potent than usual,
circumventing natural and magical defenses with ease. Select an
Element when taking this Ability; any time the monster deals damage
associated with that Element, it will deal 125% damage unless the
target has a Weakness to it, where it deals 150% as normal.
Combatants with a Resistance to the Element in question take 100%
damage; a Immunity reduces damage to 50%, while Absorbance
reduces it to 0. XP and Gil modifiers are given per Element – having
Potency towards Wind and Earth would carry a combined modifier of
+120/+82.

Elemental Resistance
Effect: The monster has an affinity towards one or more of the nine
Combat Elements, and is considered to have a Resistance to it.
Select which Element Elemental Resistance applies to when taking
this Ability. Elemental Resistance cannot be taken in conjunction with
a Weakness, Resistance, or Absorbance for the same Element. XP
and Gil modifiers are given per Element – having Resistance
towards Wind and Earth would carry a combined modifier of
+14/+6.
