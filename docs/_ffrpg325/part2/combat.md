Given the sheer number of fiendish monsters and evil empires
waiting to be vanquished in the name of justice, it shouldn't be
surprising that combat is an unavoidable part of day-to-day life in
the world of Final Fantasy. This section covers these encounters –
and more importantly, how to emerge from them alive. The chapter
itself is divided into an overview of some fundamental principles not
covered in Chapter 1, followed by an examination of how the three
Phases work in combat. Following this is an overview of some
special situations in FFRPG combat.

## THE BASICS OF COMBAT
Battles within the FFRPG are structured in a relatively
straightforward manner. The following rules are common to every
fight, regardless of scale.
Rounds and Turns
To make the flow of combat more manageable, all battles are
divided up into a number of Rounds, with every Round further
broken down into Initiative, Action, and Status Phases. The Action
Phase is divided into a number of turns; this is the space of time
during which individual combatants act. During their turns,
combatants may make one or more Actions, depending on their Job,
equipment and other circumstances.
Critical Hits and Automatic Misses
In combat, Botches and Critical Successes operate a little differently
than they would under normal circumstances. When rolling to hit
during an Attack Action, a result of 1 to 10 on a d% is considered to
be a Critical Hit, doing +100% damage and striking with an
unusually flamboyant visual effect in the process.
A roll of 95 to 100, on the other hand, is always an Automatic
Miss, regardless of the character’s Weapon Skill Rating and the
target’s Evasion. Additional penalties for Automatic Misses may be
applied at the Gamemaster's discretion. Note that this applies to
Attacks only; Automatic Misses and Critical Successes have no effects
on Spells or Abilities.
Targeting
As explained in Chapter 1, most Abilities and other attacks have a
limited range of effect, defined by its ‘Target’ type. Of the five
possible Targets, two – Self and All – are self-explanatory. The
remaining three, however, require a little more definition.
SINGLE TARGETS
A Single target is – as the name implies – a single combatant,
friendly or enemy. Such targets may be picked out of a larger
formation, or exist simply because the PCs are fighting against one
powerful foe.
PARTIES AND GROUPS
The Party simply consists of a combatant and their immediate allies
in the area. Generally, this target type is used for beneficial effects
which automatically affect allied combatants, such as the White Magic
Spell Vaccine. For balance reasons, Parties are limited to nine
combatants at a time; if there are more allies on the battlefield than
this, the combatant must decide which of their comrades are
covered by the effect in question.
Groups are formations of combatants up to nine strong, friend or
foe. This target type is used for effects that can be turned on allies
as well as enemies, inclusive of most offensive Abilities. If more than
nine valid opponents – or allies – exist, the combatant using the
Ability decides which nine are targeted.
Both Parties and Groups have a ‘coherency’ which assumes that
all members of that respective formation keep roughly within three
or four meters of one another, but this does not need to be strictly
enforced unless large distances are involved – two monsters
separated by nearly 40 meters, for instance, clearly should not
count as a single Group for purposes of calculating targets vis-à-vis
a well-aimed Thundaga Spell.
! Dealing With Multiple Groups
The 'Group' designation is purposely limited in numbers to
avoid overkill with area effects. Because of this, it is not
recommended that these limits be ignored. For larger
combats, encounters can be split into multiple Groups, but the
amount of book-keeping involved in may bog down the flow of
the game. As an alternative, attacks by larger groups of
opponents can be played out as “waves” – the first Group of
monsters attacks the players; once they have been defeated,
the second Group enters combat, and so forth.
This keeps the number of combatants to a manageable range
while still simulating the effects of attrition with a large
number of opponents.
DECLARING A TARGET
Unless they are Target: All or Self, Attacks and Abilities require the
combatant to declare a valid target when using them. In most cases,
a valid target is both active – in other words, hasn't been reduced to
0 HP or removed from the battle – and visible. Combatants affected
by the Vanish Status Condition or hiding out of sight or behind cover
are not valid targets under normal circumstances. However, they will
be affected as normal if the Group or Party they currently belong to
is targeted by an effect. Similarly, incapacitated opponents are not
considered valid targets for most Actions; the only exceptions are
effects that explicitly affect Unconscious combatants, such as Life or
an Item Action using a Phoenix Down.
Choice of target is further restricted by the target type of the
effect being used. In case of Single targets, this will be relatively
straightforward; the combatant selects one opponent or ally (“I
throw an Elixir at Food the Mage.”) and then resolves the effects of
the action. Groups are more complex, but only marginally so. If there
between one and nine opponents on the battlefield, a Target: Group
effect will hit all of them, or can be turned on a Party of up to nine
PCs or NPCs. If there are more than nine opponents on the
battlefield, the combatant must select which nine they wish to target,
provided they close enough to form a valid Group.
FRIENDLY FIRE
Single and Group effects can be turned on allies and one’s own
Party respectively, although under most circumstances, players will
refrain from baking their team-mates with a Firaga. There are
exceptions, though. One popular tactic involves casting a Spell on an
ally under the Reflect Status, resulting in an unblockable attack that
can even bypass an opponent’s own Reflect.
Other situations arise as a result of certain Status Conditions.
Sleep, Confuse, Heat, and Frozen can all be canceled by inflicting a
certain type of damage on the target; rather than wait for the
Condition to wear off, the victim’s allies may find it more expedient to
simply attack them and forcibly cancel it.
SWITCHING SIDES
Combatants affected by the Status Condition Charm or the Ability
Control may well end up attacking their own allies or healing their
sworn opponents. For purposes of targeting, however, the ‘traitor’ is
part of their original Group or Party. For example, if a monster aims
a Thundara at a party that includes an opponent it’s successfully
Charmed, that opponent would still be hit – attacks that affect an
entire formation always affect everyone within that formation,
regardless of which ‘side’ they are currently fighting for.
RANDOM TARGETS
Certain effects like Confuse call for a ‘randomly determined’ target.
In such cases, simply roll a d% for every eligible combatant – the
one with the highest roll is the one affected. The definition of
‘eligible’ will usually be given with the effect in question: a ‘randomly
determined opponent’ means rolling for all opponents on the
battlefield; a ‘randomly determined ally’ means rolling for all allies. If
neither is explicitly stated, make a roll for all active combatants.
Ranges
Range is not intended to be a major factor in most FFRPG battles. In
the e-games, combat tended to be restricted to areas small enough
that characters and monster could stare each other straight in the
face, reducing the amount of movement to a bare minimum. FFRPG
battles may be more expansive than this, but for the most part, it's
easiest to assume that everybody remains within easy movement
distance of each other and the only practical difference between
Ranged and Melee attacks is the Reactions they trigger.
If range ever becomes an actual factor in or out of combat, use
the following guidelines:
MELEE
"Melee" means up close and personal; accordingly, Melee effects can
only be used within 1 to 3 meters of a target. If Status Conditions,
terrain, or other circumstances make it impossible to close to this
range, no Melee effects may be used.
RANGED
Ranged effects can hit from a distance, making them more
convenient in situations where Melee effects cannot be used. By
default, Ranged effects can affect targets up to 15 meters away;
exceptions to the rule will have their maximum effective range given
in parentheses. Ranged (30), for example, means that the effect can
reach up to 30 meters.
MULTI-TARGET EFFECTS
Both Group and Party effects radiate out over a circular area
roughly 10 meters in diameter, affecting any eligible target even
partially within its reach. In-game, the size of the area will be a moot
point most of the time – because combatants have to be in close
proximity to qualify as a Group or Party under the FFRPG rules and
the size of either formation is explicitly limited, players should never
worry about whether or not they can squeeze everything in the
Group into the range of a Firaga.
TARGET: ALL
Effects with Target: All radiate out to cover a circular area roughly 50
meters in diameter. Most FFRPG battles are small enough in scale to
ensure that they will utterly consumed by an All effect; in larger
conflicts, an All effect will still be cataclysmic, albeit only to a smaller
portion of the overall engagement.
Movement
Because the ‘typical’ Final Fantasy battle takes place in a relatively
confined space, most movement in combat is assumed to be too
trivial to keep track of. However, on larger battlefields, how fast
characters can move from Point A to Point B can start being an
issue. In this case, use the following guidelines:
FREE MOVEMENT
During their turns, combatants can move a distance in meters equal
to their SPD Attributes without penalty. This distance does not have
to be covered all at once, and may be split into separate movements
before as well as after an Action has been made.
FULL MOVES
Spending an Action exclusively on movement allows a combatant to
move a distance in meters equal to (Combatant's SPD x 2). A
character with an SPD of 20, for instance, could move 40 meters
with each Action spent on movement.
TERRAIN EFFECTS
The kind of terrain a combatant moves over will affect how far they
can move – logically, dashing across flat and solid ground will get
you further than trying to do the same in a dense jungle rich with
creepers and vines. To make it easier for GMs to decide how terrain
affects movement, all battlefield terrain can be broken into one of
five categories.
Standard Terrain is exactly that – areas that are assumed to be
the norm for combat movement. Standard Terrain has no effect on
movement – combatants move across it at the normal rate.
Difficult Terrain slows combatants' movement by smaller but still
noticeable amounts. When traversing Difficult Terrain, the total
distance a combatant can move is reduced by 25%. Examples of
Difficult Terrain include light snow, shallow water, and unsteady
ground.
Adverse Terrain has a significant effect on combatants' movement.
When traversing Adverse Terrain, the total distance a combatant can
move is reduced by 50%. Deep snow and ice are both examples of
Adverse Terrain.
Impassable Terrain is exactly what the name implies – areas of the
battlefield that cannot be crossed under normal circumstances,
making them effectively off-limits to combatants without Float or Fly.
In the unlikely event that a combatant ends up thrown into
Impassable Terrain, the result is usually Ejection or instant death.
Bottomless pits, ravines, and lava fields are all examples of
Impassable Terrain.
Water presents a case unique enough to warrant a terrain
category of its very own. If the water merely reaches to the
combatant's waist, it is considered Adverse Terrain. If the combatant
has to actually swim or dive through it, however, it is not only
counted as Adverse Terrain, but requires them to devote all of their
actions to movement and movement alone for as long as they
remain in the water.
Combatants with Move-Water or Swimming at a rating of 80 or
higher may make Actions as normal whilst in water. The same applies
to any combatants with technological or magical assistance.
FLOATING AND FLYING COMBATANTS
Being able to defy the clutches of gravity naturally makes one more
mobile in battle. Combatants under the effects of Float ignore all
movement modifiers for terrain, but cannot cannot make Full-Move
Actions; Combatants with Flight ignore all movement modifiers while
flying, and suffer no penalties for doing so.
Doing Damage
The ultimate goal of combat is to inflict enough damage on one’s
opponents to permanently put them out of commission, or subdue
them long enough to make a clean getaway. While simple in principle,
the specifics are a little more involved than immediately apparent.
TARGETS AND APPLYING DAMAGE
Unless otherwise noted, damage done by attacks is applied to all
combatants targeted by them, then modified by each individual
combatant’s ARM or M. ARM to determine the actual damage
inflicted. If a Fira Spell inflicting 60 damage hit three monsters with
M. ARM 10, 20 and 30 respectively, for instance, they would lose 50,
40 and 30 HP.
! Single/Group
Spells with the Single/Group designation allow the caster to
split the effects over a larger group for reduced effectiveness.
Such Spells do 100% of the listed damage to Single
combatants and 75% damage to Groups.
CURRENT AND MAXIMUM VALUES
In as well as out of battle, a distinction is made between a
combatant’s ‘current’ Hit and Magic Points and their ‘maximum’
values. The maximum value is equal to the Hit and Magic Points
generated at character creation, plus any bonuses gained from
Levels and equipment. The current value is the maximum value,
modified by any gains or losses of Hit and Magic Points over the
course of the battle. For instance, an uninjured combatant with a
maximum HP value of 40 begins the battle with a current HP value
of 40. If he loses 10 Hit Points to an attack in the first Round, his
current HP value drops to 30, though his maximum value remains
unaffected. The current value can never exceed the maximum value;
if a combatant regains more Hit or Magic Points than their maximum
value, the excess is lost.
REACHING 0 HP
What happens when a combatant is reduced to 0 or fewer Hit Points
depends on who they are. In case of most monsters and other
NPCs, it will mean they are disposed of and take no further part in
the battle. For more powerful opponents, the results may vary; they
may shift to another incarnation, die spectacularly, or merely
teleport to safety, vowing to return and take their revenge another
day.
When a PC reaches 0 or fewer HP, they are rendered Unconscious
– not in any immediate danger of death, but in no position to
continue fighting. Unconscious characters generate no Initiative, and
therefore neither move nor act during the course of a Round. All
Status Conditions affecting the character – excepting the Condition
Stone and any Transform-type Conditions – are automatically
canceled, regardless of their remaining timers. Auto-Status
Conditions resume effect only once the PC is back on his or her feet.
Unconscious PCs cannot regain Hit Points from most Recovery
effects. The only things capable of restoring them are Items and
Spells that specifically affect an Unconscious combatant. Once their
Hit Points have been restored to 1 or greater, they are no longer
considered Unconscious, and may once again generate Initiative.
Alternately, PCs may also be revived through recuperation at a GM’s
discretion – see Chapter 9 for more details on this.
THE INITIATIVE PHASE
Initiative in combat is generated as outlined in Chapter 1, though
certain Status Conditions and Abilities may affect the outcome of the
Initiative rolls. Once all Initiatives have been generated, the Initiative
Phase ends; the Round moves into the Action Phase.
? Initiative in Action (1)
Having escaped their cell, our heroes now make a desperate
break for freedom… and encounter trouble along the way.
Rodger (GM): Deathsight's dungeon seems to stretch on into
an infinity of dank metallic staircases. Occasionally, steaming
vents and rattling chains break up the monotony; strange
lights flash in the gloom, indicators for some mysterious
device buried deep in the walls. You’re just starting at catch
your breath at the top of the third set of steps when a blue
light illuminates the gloomy stairwell. Then another --
footsteps grow louder, underscored by soft, tinny clinks. You
step back instinctively as two of Deathsight's mechanical
guards round the corner; tailing them is a grotesque
assemblage of gears and steam pipes bent into a vaguely
hound-like shape, oil dripping from the crushed metal of its
head. The first guard buzzes with surprise as he notices you,
then reaches for his sword.
? Initiative in Action (2)
Rob (Hiro): Hiro shakes his head as he unholsters his gun.
“No turning back now. Let’s get ‘em!”
Rodger: Everybody else is following?
Carl (Kumani): The only way back’s down to the dungeons
again. We’ve got to keep going.
M (Haze): Sure thing.
Rodger: Roll initiatives.
Rob: (rolling) D’oh. 2. Plus Speed 5 equals 7.
M: (rolling) 6 plus Speed 8 equals 14.
Blair: (rolling) Hey, a 10! …plus Speed 8 equals 18.
Carl: (rolling) 6. Plus Speed 8 equals… 14.
Rodger rolls in secret, coming up with a 1, 5 and 3. The two
Guards have SPD 5, so their Initiatives are 6 and 10; the Oily
Fang has SPD 7, coming up with an Initiative of 10.
Rodger: Right. Order of initiative is Mint with 18, Kumani with
14, Haze with 13, Oily Fang with 10, Guard B with 10, Guard A
with 8...
For reference’s sake, Rodger distinguishes between the
Guards by assigning them letter codes. This will help keep
down confusion between players in a fight where two of their
opponents are of the same enemy type.
Rodger: …and Hiro with 7.
The Round's timer begins at 18 ticks – Mint's Initiative – with
Mint taking the first turn.
Conflicting Initiatives
The above example poses an interesting question – what happens
when multiple combatants generate the same Initiative score? While
the combatants in question still take their turns on the same tick, the
combatant with the highest SPD automatically has the first turn, the
combatant with the next-highest SPD the second, and so forth. In
the example, both Guard B and the Oily Fang started with an
Initiative of 10, yet the Fang acted first, as it had the higher SPD
value of the two. If the Fang and the Guard had had identical SPD
Attributes, however, they would have been deadlocked. In this case,
Rodger would have had to roll a d10 for both to resolve the
situation; whoever rolled highest would then act first.
THE ACTION PHASE
The Action Phase makes up the bulk of each Round. During this
period of time, combatants can cast spells, use special powers,
make attacks, and reposition themselves. Once all movement and
Actions have been dealt with, the Round moves into the Status
Phase.
Actions
Combat is a complex swirl of activities and manuevers, ranging from
simply striking a pose to cleaving demons in twain with a well-placed
sword-stroke. For the sake of keeping things simple, the FFRPG
groups these activities into two broad headings.
ZERO ACTIONS
Zero Actions are trivial Actions, and consume less time and effort
than a full-blown Action. A character may make up to two Zero
Actions each turn. Some examples of Zero Actions include:
Combat Movement. Because combatants can freely attack each
other by default, almost all attacks are assumed to include a certain
amount of movement. A character making a standard melee attack,
for instance, would first need to run up to her target to deliver the
blow, then retreat to safety before said target could strike back. This
kind of movement is called Combat Movement, and treated as a Zero
Action. More extensive movement requires an Action as normal.
Communication. Communication is an important part of battle,
even if it is used for nothing more than idle boasting and taunts.
Proclamations (“Watch out for its lightning attack!”) and ten- to
thirty-second conversations are both treated as Zero Actions.
Style Moves. Small actions primarily meant to show a character's
personality in combat – pausing to adjust one's sleeves, flexing after
a successful strike, flipping aside an immaculately-styled length of
hair before delivering a finishing blow.
Reactions. The final, and arguably most important, example of a
Zero Action. Because a combatant's Reactions rarely occur to their
own turn, they don't count towards the limit of two Zero Actions per
turn.
STANDARD ACTIONS
More intensive activities – making attacks, casting spells, fiddling
with a potion bag in search of a curative – are treated as 'standard'
Actions. Unlike Zero Actions, combatants are only allowed one
standard Action per turn, though it is possible to gain additional
Actions through Abilities like Fast Pockets or Spells like Quick.
Standard Actions are further divided into nine categories, collectively
covering the majority of possible battlefield activities: Full-Move,
Attack, Ability, Trigger, Item, Defense, Wait and Escape. Each of these
is covered in detail in subsequent sections.
SLOW ACTIONS AND INITIATIVE
As explained in Chapter 1, Slow Actions require a certain amount of
preparation before they can be used. This ‘charging’ is represented
through a Charge Time (CT) listed in parentheses with the Ability
type. Each point of Charge Time is roughly equivalent to one second
or tick of charging; an Ability with a Charge Time of 18 would require
18 ticks of uninterrupted concentration before its effects take hold.
When a Slow Action is declared in battle, the Charge Time is
subtracted from the combatant's basic Initiative for the Round. The
new, adjusted Initiative is when the Action is resolved. For instance,
if a combatant with an Initiative of 18 declares they are using an
Action with a CT of 12, the actual Action is resolved at 6 ticks. The
character spends the intervening 12 ticks charging.
! Interrupting Slow Actions
Because Slow Actions are not resolved immediately, it is
possible that a character may be struck with a Status
Condition which prevents them from carrying out the Action –
Berserk, Confuse, Sleep, and Curse are all obvious examples
– or reduced to 0 or fewer HP before the Action is resolved. If
either of these occurs, the Action is automatically canceled. A
character may also voluntarily abort a Slow Action, nullifying
that action.
If CT reduces a character’s Initiative to less than 0, the remaining
CT ‘carries over’ and is subtracted from their Initiative in the
subsequent Round. The Slow Action is then resolved at the new,
modified Initiative in that Round. If a combatant opted to use a Slow
Action with a CT of 12 on an Initiative of 8, for instance, the CT
would reduce their Initiative to -4. As this is lower than 0, nothing
would happen in the Round the Action was declared. In the following
Round, the combatant generates Initiative as normal, then subtracts
the remaining CT of 4 ticks; the Slow Action is resolved at this
reduced Initiative count. Note that any CT that ends up delaying an
Action for one or more Rounds results in the combatant’s normal
turn being ‘skipped over;' any Actions they could have made during
that time are automatically forfeited.
! Retargeting Slow Actions
If the target of a Slow Action is incapacitated or removed from
the battle before the Action’s effect takes place, the Action is
retargeted, striking a random opponent instead.
EXTREME INITIATIVES
Under most circumstances, combatants only have one turn per
Round. However, there are times in which a combatant can surpass
the one-turn limitation through sheer speed alone.
Combatants with an Initiative value higher than 35 at the end of
the Initiative Phase have Extreme Initiative. In game terms, they are
eligible for additional turns during the course of the Round. When
the combatant’s turn comes up, perform an Action as usual; after
the Action has been carried out, reduce the combatant's remaining
Initiative by 35. If this leaves them with an Initiative greater than 0,
they may take another turn at the new Initiative count, subtracting a
further 35 from their Initiative after the completion of every
subsequent turn until their Initiative is less than or equal to 0. Note
that Actions with a Charge Time add their given CT to this 35-tick
penalty; the Action is performed on the adjusted Initiative count as
normal. For instance, if a Thief with an Initiative of 50 decided to
use Mug (Slow, CT 10) on an opponent, its effects would go off at
40 ticks, after which the Thief’s Initiative count would be reduced by
35 to 5. As this is greater than 0, the Thief takes another turn at 5
ticks.
While there is no penalty for reducing Initiative to a negative value
through Fast Actions, a Slow Action that reduces the combatant’s
Initiative count to less than zero will carry over into the next Round
as normal.
Attack Actions
An Attack Action is a combatant's standard means of offense, and
involves striking targets with whatever Weapon is currently
equipped. Actions of this type are resolved through the five following
steps:
1. Select a Target. With a few notable exceptions, all Attack Actions
are Single-target. This means the attacker selects one eligible
combatant from all active combatants on the battlefield and declares
them as the target.
2. Roll to Hit. The success of an Attack Action is determined in the
same manner as a Skill Test – the attacker makes a Percentile Roll to
beat a given CoS. In this case, the CoS is equal to (Attacker’s ACC,
using the relevant weapon skill), Target's Evasion, where the
Weapon Skill in question is the one required by the equipped Weapon
used in the attack: Staves for a Staff, Swords for a Greatsword or
Katana, and so on. If the attacker manages to roll equal to or under
the CoS, they succeed in hitting their target and proceed to the next
step. Otherwise, they miss and have wasted their Action.
Not every attack needs to be this straightforward – GMs can easily
apply Conditional Modifiers to simulate the effects of extreme glare,
encumbrance, or nighttime conditions. However, such modifiers
should generally only be used in extraordinary circumstances to
avoid bogging battles down with small details.
? Sample Attack (1)
With all Initiatives generated, the battle begins in earnest.
Rodger (GM): Mint’s turn.
Blair (Mint): Mint draws her Rod of Darkness as the Guards
close in, smashing Guard A straight in the face with as much
force as she can muster.
Rodger: Roll to hit.
Blair: (rolling) 48. Accuracy with Cudgels comes out to 97.
Here Rodger consults his notes. The Guards’ Evasion is only
22; Blair’s roll comfortably beats the adjusted CoS of 75.
Rodger: Mint’s attack connects, slamming into the guard’s
helmet with a sharp clang. Roll for damage.
3. Generate Damage. Each Weapon has its own ‘damage code,’
expressed in terms of a Damage Scale and a Damage Die. A Weapon
with a damage code of (3 x STR) + d10, for instance, is said to
have a Damage Scale of 3 and a Damage Die of d10.
To determine how much damage the attack inflicts, multiply the
Damage Scale by the Attribute in question – in this case, Strength –
and then roll the Damage Die, adding the result to the total. The final
number is the basic damage inflicted by the Attack. For a speedier
resolution, it helps to have the damage code precalculated before
the battle begins.
Effects such as [Element] Strike or the Status Condition Power Up
change this raw damage output by a certain percentage. The same
applies to Critical Hits, which increase basic damage dealt by a
successful Attack Action by +100%. Such bonuses should be
applied when basic damage is calculated.
? Sample Attack (2)
Mint’s Rod of Darkness has a damage code of (2 x STR +
d6), ARM. To save time, Mint's player, Blair, has already
multiplied her Strength, 8, by the Damage Scale of 2 for a
total of 16.
Blair (Mint): (rolling) 5. Plus 16 is 21.
Rodger (GM): All right. Now Armor…
4. Adjust Damage. Once the basic damage has been calculated,
subtract either the target’s ARM rating if it is Physical damage, or M.
ARM if it is Magical damage. The end result is the total damage
inflicted on the target – reduce the target’s current HP by that
amount. Should this take the target to 0 or fewer HP, it will be
incapacitated and takes no further part in the battle.
? Sample Attack (3)
As Mint’s Rod of Darkness inflicts Physical damage, the attack
will be reduced by the Guard’s ARM. Rodger consults his
notes again, finding the Guard has an ARM of 6. Subtracted
from Mint's basic damage of 21, this means the attack inflicts
a total 15 HP damage to the hapless mechanoid. Not enough
to put him out of commission, but there's always next
round…
Rodger (GM): 15 damage. Roll for Blind…
5. Resolve Other Effects. If the Weapon has any Equipment
Abilities that have not already been applied to the attack, they are
brought into play after the target’s Hit Points have been adjusted.
The player rolls a d% against whatever CoS may apply.
? Sample Attack (4)
The Rod of Darkness has the Equipment Ability Blind Touch,
giving Mint a flat CoS of 30 for inflicting Blind on the Guard in
addition to the damage she’s already done.
Blair (Mint): (rolling) Woo. 14.
Rodger (GM): The Guard staggers back as the light in his
visor dims, frantically flailing his sword about. Guard A’s got
Status Condition Blind with a timer of 4.
A few other details regarding Attack Actions also worth noting:
AMMO
Characters attacking with a Weapon that supports the use of
ammunition may choose to use one unit of it in the Attack Action.
This must be declared when first announcing the attack’s target; the
effects of the selected ammunition are then applied accordingly.
Note that the unit of ammunition is used up regardless of whether
the Attack Action is successful or not.
BRAWLING
If a character does not have a Weapon equipped, they may still
attack bare-handed. This form of attack is known as Brawling. Attack
Actions made in this fashion are handled as normal, using the
character’s Brawl rating in place of the usual Weapon Skill. Such
attacks have a damage code of (1 x STR) + d6.
ATTACKING OFF-HANDED
Most characters wield Weapons exclusively in one hand or the other,
a habit further reinforced by their training. If they are ever forced to
equip a Weapon in a hand other than their customary one, they
suffer a flat -50 penalty to ACC unless they have the Two Weapons
Skill; if so, they suffer no penalty, but use Two Weapons instead of
the normal Weapon Skill when rolling to hit.
ATTACKING WITH TWO WEAPONS
Characters with two Weapons equipped strike two blows with each
Attack Action, one per Weapon. For purposes of rolling to hit,
damage, and the like, each attack is treated as a separate Attack
Action. A character equipped with a Mythril Knife and a Mythril Rod,
for instance, would resolve the attack as if they had made one Attack
Action with the Mythril Knife and one with the Mythril Rod, rolling to
hit for each. If one attack misses, the other still proceeds as normal;
if both miss, the Action is wasted.
PULLING BLOWS
Not every attack needs to hit home with life-threatening force. A
combatant can declare that they are pulling a blow at the beginning
of an Attack Action. In doing so, damage for the subsequent attack
is reduced by -50%.
IMPROVISED WEAPONS
An Attack Action can also be used to pick up odds and ends capable
of being used as offensive items and make an immediate attack with
them. Such improvised weapons can take many forms: chairs,
paperweights, ornamental swords, and frying pans are all valid
fodder for heroes short on armaments but big on imagination.
Attack Actions made with such objects are resolved as normal,
using the most appropriate Weapon Skill to calculate rolls to hit.
Damage is calculated using the damage code of a standard d6, d8,
d10, or d12 weapon with an Equipment Tier half that of the
character’s normally equipped Weapon. The die type used is left to
the GM’s discretion, but should take into account the size and ‘heft’
of the object; the larger the object, the higher the die.
For instance, a character who had previously wielded a Tier 4
Weapon and picks up a laundry pole in a tense brawl would treat it
as a Tier 2 Weapon. In this case, the laundry pole's size and length
means it would be closest to a Staff, making it a d8 Weapon. For
purposes of calculating damage, it would thus be treated as as a
Tier 2 Staff, doing damage equal to a Crescent Pole, or (3 x STR) +
d8. Unlike normal Weapons, improvised Weapons aren’t made to last;
most will be destroyed after the first Attack Action, while more
durable ones last until end of the battle at best. They also usually
lack Equipment Abilities, though some improvised Weapons may
inflict Status Conditions (2) in addition to or instead of damage,
depending on their nature. For example, throwing a handful of chili
powder at an opponent would do no damage, but instead have a
chance of inflicting Blind. Such Status Conditions always have a flat
CoS of 30%; the Status Condition inflicted is chosen by the GM.
Ability Actions
Ability Actions allow combatants to take active advantage of the
powers and talents in their Ability Sets. While Attack Actions are
relatively straightforward, the wide range of effects found in a
character’s Ability Set means very few operate in exactly the same
manner. A general set of steps for resolving Ability Actions is given
below, though not every step will apply to every Ability.
1. Select a Target. Abilities can have a wide variety of Target
types, ranging from Self to All. Target: Self, Target: Party and Target:
All do not give the combatant much choice in what to target, but
Target: Single and Target: Group do – in this case, the combatant
must declare an eligible target or group of targets for the Ability to
affect.
2. Adjust MP. Certain Abilities require a number of Magic Points to
use. If the Ability has an MP cost associated with it, begin by
subtracting the effect’s MP cost from the combatant’s current MP
score. The desired effect may only be used if this leaves the
character with 0 or more MP; otherwise, the combatant will have to
choose another course of action. If no MP cost is given for the
effect, proceed to the next step.
3. Adjust Initiative. Slow Abilities deduct a Charge Time from the
combatant’s Initiative. If the combatant is using a Slow Ability, adjust
their Initiative accordingly and continue on to the next applicable
step once the effect goes off.
? Sample Ability (1)
Mint has just completed her turn. Now it’s Carl’s character,
Kumani, who acts.
Rodger (GM): Kumani’s up.
Carl wants to use a Magic Ability, all of which require MP. A
quick glance at his character sheet for Kumani’s MP – 21 –
confirms he’s got enough to use every Blue Magic Spell
currently in her arsenal.
Carl (Kumani): Kumani will focus on the Oily Fang, going
through the fluid kata for Leap before jumping into the air,
claws outstretched. 8 MP; leaves her with 13.
Carl makes a note on his character sheet, subtracting the 8
MP from his current score. With no Charge Time, he proceeds
straight to the next step.
Rodger: All right. Roll for M. ACC.
4. Roll To Hit. Most Abilities take effect automatically, but some may
require a d% roll. If so, the relevant CoS will be noted in its
description. Spells used against an opponent always require a
successful Percentile Roll to use; in this case, the CoS will be equal to
(Caster’s M. ACC + Additional Modifiers), Target's M. Evasion, where
the 'Additional Modifiers' are those listed in the Spell’s description. If
no modifiers are given, simply subtract the target’s M. EVA.
If the attacker manages to roll equal to or under the CoS, they
succeed in hitting their target and proceed to the next step.
Otherwise, they miss and have wasted their Action, plus any MP and
Initiative spent on it.
? Sample Ability (2)
Checking Leap’s Spell description, Carl finds no modifiers for
basic accuracy. As a result, his base M. ACC of 115 stands.
Carl (Kumani): (rolling) 76, against M. ACC of 115.
Rodger checks his notes for the Oily Fang’s M. EVA – 24. 115
minus 24 is 91; Carl’s roll of 76 is well under.
Rodger (GM): That’s a hit – Kumani lands squarely on the
mechanical hound with a hollow thud, knocking several pipes
out of alignment. Time to roll for damage…
5. Generate Damage. If the Ability inflicts damage, the damage
code will be found in its description. Damage adjustments caused by
effects like [Element] Enhancer, Status Conditions like Magic Up, or
Elemental Weaknesses, Resistances, and Immunities will be factored
in at this point. Begin by adding together all percentage modifiers
with a + or - in front of them, then adding these to 100%. Apply the
final percentage to the damage generated. If no damage code is
given in the description, skip ahead to the seventh step.
6. Adjust Damage. Once the basic damage has been calculated,
subtract either the target’s ARM or M. ARM rating, depending on
which of the two is given in the damage code. If neither is given, the
damage is not reduced. The end result is the total damage inflicted
on the target – reduce the target’s current HP by that amount.
Should this reduce the target to 0 or fewer HP, it will be
incapacitated and takes no further part in the battle.
? Sample Ability (3)
Like Blair, Carl has precalculated damage. Kumani’s MAG is 7;
factored into Leap’s damage code of (4 x MAG) + d8, this
means the Spell does 28 + d8 damage.
Carl (Kumani): (rolling) 6. 34 damage.
Rodger consults his notes – the Fang’s M. ARM is 8, meaning
the attack does 26 damage.
Rodger (GM): Good hit! 26 damage. Roll for Armor Down.
7. Resolve Other Effects. Certain Abilities and Spells may inflict one
or more Status Condition instead of or in addition to damage. The
durations for these will always be given in the Ability’s or Spell’s
description. Status Conditions inflicted by damaging attacks have an
additional CoS separate from the main attack, and will require a d%
to determine whether these take effect.
? Sample Ability (4)
Leap also has a (M. ACC - 50), M. Evasion chance of inflicting
the Status Condition Armor Down. This reduces Kumani’s M.
ACC to 65.
Carl (Kumani): (rolling) 14, against a modified M. ACC of 65.
Subtracting the Fang’s M. EVA of 24 from the modified M.
ACC, Rodger finds Armor Down’s CoS is 41. Once again, Carl’s
roll is comfortably under.
Rodger (GM): The Fang’s now suffering from Armor Down,
duration of four Rounds. Haze, you’re up…
Trigger Actions
Trigger Actions cover in-combat activities that require a Task Checks
to carry out. Examples of Trigger Actions include lifting up a table
and throwing it at a charging opponent with STR, using Systems to
disable an out-of-control mechanoid, catching a falling sword
through AGI, or or using Acrobatics to execute a triple cartwheel
through a group of Imperial soldiers onto an overhanging balcony. A
Conditional Modifier is applied by the GM as normal, and should take
the combatant’s shape and circumstances into account – somebody
who’s just spent the last six Rounds bashing Stropers is not going to
be in much form to lift a one-ton boulder in the seventh. Depending
on the complexity of the Trigger Action, the GM may also choose to
impose a Charge Time.
A successful Task Check is required before the Action can be
carried out. Failure means a combatant has wasted their Action,
while consequences for a Botch or Critical Success are left to GM
discretion. Trigger Actions can also be used for Actions that do not
require a roll or directly target an combatant, but are too ‘major’ to
be treated as Zero Actions – pushing a button, kicking over a torch,
or maneuvering a crane into position.
? Sample Trigger Action
Haze’s player weighs his next course of action. At this point,
the party’s survival depends on their ability to stop the
guards from alerting their fellows – if either one escapes, the
consequences could be dire.
M (Haze): Rodger, I want to make a leap up the stairs,
shutting the door and sealing it. Do I have enough clearance
on the stairwell to get behind the guards?
Rodger sees this as an Average task; no Conditional Modifiers
applied, making the CoS equal to Haze’s AGI Attribute Rating,
Rodger (GM): Sure. Give me a roll against your AGI.
M: (rolling) 25, Attribute Rating of 31.
Rodger: Smooth. Haze manages to vault onto the rail and dive
behind the second guard before either of the two realizes
what’s happening, sliding the bolts into place. There’s an
angry snarl as one guard trains the Fang on you as the
second slowly steps down the stairs towards the rest of the
party…
Item Actions
Item Actions involve a character's equipment or Inventory. An Item
Action may be used to do any of the following:
Use an Item. Any character with a Throwing Weapon, Battle Item,
Support Item, or Recovery Item in their Inventory Slot may expend
an Item Action to retrieve it and use it on a valid target. Standard
targeting rules and restrictions apply.
Equip a Weapon or Shield. If a character does not have a Weapon
or Shield equipped but has one in their Inventory Slot or within easy
reach, they may expend an Item Action to equip it. This assumes
they have the appropriate Slot free.
Replace, Return or Drop a Weapon or Shield. An Item Action may
be used to replace a currently-equipped Weapon or Shield with one
in the character’s Inventory or the general vicinity, or return a
Weapon or Shield to the inventory, thereby de-equipping it. The piece
of equipment in question may be dropped or discarded instead.
Drop or Discard an Item: One Item Action may be used to drop or
permanently remove an Item from a character’s Inventory Slot.
? Sample Item Action
Hiro’s turn comes last in the Round. Guards A and B have
both attacked Mint, and the Oily Fang’s taken a healthy chunk
out of Hiro. Rob considers his options…
Rodger (GM): Rob? It’s Hiro’s turn.
Rob (Hiro): Hmm. Blair, how’s Mint doing?
Blair (Mint): 17 HP left. One hit from that Fang, and she’s a
goner. How about a heal?
Rob checks his character sheet – sure enough, he’s got two
Potions in his Inventory Slot, each capable of restoring 50 HP
to a Single combatant.
Rob: Can do. Rodger, I’m chucking a Potion in Mint’s direction.
Rodger: Mint recovers 50 Hit Points… and that’s the end of
the Action Phase. Time to move on to the Status Phase.
Full-Move Actions
As described earlier in the chapter, combatants can devote an Action
to nothing but movement in order to cover greater distances. Such
Actions are called Full-Move Actions.
Defense Actions
In a Defense Action, a combatant braces for the worst the enemy
can throw at them. Defense Actions must be declared at the
beginning of the combatant’s turn, before any other Actions are
made. In doing so, the character automatically forfeits their first
Action for that Round. In exchange, all damage they receive until
they take their next Action is reduced by -50% after adjusting for
ARM and M. ARM.
Waiting
If everything else fails, a combatant may choose to simply wait. The
player declares how many ticks they spend waiting, and adjusts
Initiative accordingly. For example, a combatant with an initial
Initiative of 24 may decide to wait 5 ticks and take their turn at an
Initiative of 19 instead. If the combatant does not wish to act at their
new, reduced Initiative count, they may continue to wait instead of
taking an Action. Should this eventually reduce their Initiative count
to 0 or lower, they automatically forfeit all remaining Actions for the
Round. Note that any effects with a Charge Time use the combatant’s
reduced Initiative as a basis.
Escape Actions
Sometimes, it's better to run and fight another day than stand and
be slaughtered. If a combatant wishes to attempt to escape the
battle, they must declare an Escape Action during the Initiative
Phase. When their turn comes up in the Action Phase, they must
make an opposed Task Check pitting their SPD against that of all
opponents still actively engaged in the battle. Opponents who have
been incapacitated do not participate in this Check. If an opponent
has no interest in preventing the escape, they likewise waive the roll.
The escapee rolls only once, comparing the result to all other rolls.
If it is the highest roll, the escape is successful and the combatant is
removed from the battle. If not, the Action has been wasted.
As always, Conditional Modifiers can be applied for situations such
as attempting to run through difficult or hazardous terrain, or
escaping from a monster whose attention is otherwise engaged.

## The Status Phase

In combat, the Status Phase is used to do three things:
1. Adjusting Timers. Most Status Conditions only have a limited
duration in combat, indicated by a 'timer' of 2, 4, or 6 Rounds.
During the Status Phase, reduce the value of each active 'timer' by
one. Should this give the timer a value to 0, the Status Condition is
canceled

> ! Tracking Duration  
When multiple Status Conditions enter the picture, it may be
more convenient to track timers visually. The best way to do
so is with a colored d6 displaying the remaining duration. At
the end of each Status Phase, adjust the die accordingly so
the side facing up shows the current timer. When the timer
reaches 0 or the Status Condition is cancelled, simply remove
the die.

2. Resolving Effects. Certain Status Conditions such as Poison and
Regen affect their targets on a Round-to-Round basis. For instance,
Poison reduces a victim’s HP by 10% of its current value for each
Status Phase it remains in effect. These effects are all calculated and
applied during the Status Phase.

3. Refreshing Auto-Status Conditions. In addition to the Status
Conditions inflicted during the course of the Round, combatants may
also be affected by Auto-Status Conditions of one sort or another. If
the Status Condition in question has been canceled during the
Round, it is automatically re-applied to the combatant during the
Status Phase.

Once all active Status Conditions have been addressed, the Round
ends, and a new Round begins at the Initiative Phase.

> ? Sample Status Phase
Now the Action Phase is over. There are two Status Conditions
in play as the Round enters the Status Phase; the Rozelle
Fang’s Armor Down and Guard A’s Blind. Armor Down and
Blind both have a timer of 4; this is reduced to 3, meaning
the Status Conditions will wear off in another three Rounds’
time.  
Rodger: All right. Initiatives…

Different status conditions can be found in the [Appendix: Statuses](/ffrpg325/appendicies/statuses/).

THE SPOILS OF BATTLE
If the PCs prevail over their opponents, they will be rewarded for
their troubles. This payoff can come in the following three forms:
Gil and XP. Every defeated opponent has a value in Gil and XP. For
simplicity’s sake, these values are tallied up for all opponents
defeated in the course of the battle, taking into account any foes
that were Ejected from the fight or ran away on their own accord.
The total is then divided evenly among all PCs.
“The way I see it, every battle brings
you one step closer to your dream.”
Seifer Almasy
FINAL FANTASY VIII
How the reward is claimed is another matter entirely; though
finding 300 gold pieces on a dead shark is well and acceptable for a
Final Fantasy game, some GMs may prefer to adopt a more realistic
approach. For this reason, it may be convenient to think of the Gil
value as representing the economic value of hides, bones, fangs
and other by-products derived from the monster’s corpse. Stripping
these requires a successful roll against Scavenge, with the Gil
equivalent being awarded once the party drags their harvested
odds and ends to the nearest trader.
Items. Provided they haven’t been Ejected, some opponents may
also drop more concrete rewards: Recovery, Battle or Support
Items, pieces of Armor or Weapons, Materials, or other odds and
ends whose uses may not be immediately obvious. Again, how the
GM chooses to award such equipment is a matter of individual
discretion; the rewards can either drop directly from the monster –
cheerfully ignoring the logical problems inherent in, say, a high-class
suit of mail being pulled off the corpse of a dinosaur – or be
‘processed’ from the monster’s remains, requiring a successful
Scavenge roll and trip into town to redeem.
Unlike Gil and XP, item rewards will rarely come in quantities large
enough to make a totally even split possible, meaning PCs must
decide amongst themselves who walks away with the loot. More
detailed notes on determining rewards and drops for monsters can
be found in Chapter 10 and Appendix II.
? Dividing the Spoils (1)
A few short rounds later, the Guards and their charge have been
wiped out. Rodger consults his notes…
Rodger (GM): With a feeble croak, the second Guard collapses,
armor rattling. You gain 120 XP and 90 Gil apiece from the
encounter. In addition… (rolling) You find a Potion and two
Tinctures.
Rob (Hiro): I’ll take the Potion. I used one up healing Mint earlier,
so it’s only fair.
M (Haze): What about the Tinctures?
Blair (Mint): Carl’s character is the only one who can really use
them at the moment. I’d say let him have them.
? Dividing the Spoils (2)
Rob: Fine by me.
Carl (Kumani): All right. I’ll take ‘em. Now, the next big question is
– how do you want to take it from here on?
Blair: We can’t be sure that fight didn’t attract more trouble just
yet. If we just charge ahead, we could get ourselves in some
serious hot soup.
Carl: Playing it cautiously might be smarter. We should send our
stealthiest party members up through the door to scout out the
situation; the rest will follow at a safe distance and be ready to
back them up if they run into any trouble.
Rob: Sounds good to me. That’d be… Mint and Haze?
Blair: Yep.
M: Sure. If we can pick off the guards in small numbers and avoid
tripping any alarms…
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
Not every battle is a straightforward face-off. Sometimes, characters
will find themselves fighting under unusual circumstances that
require them to exercise additional strategy and care.
Ambush and Surprise
The element of surprise has always had its place in Final Fantasy
battles. In earlier games in the series, combat occurred randomly,
meaning that monsters seemed to literally pounce on the heroes
from out of nowhere. In the FFRPG, however, characters can pick
their battles – if they spot a monster before it spots them, they can
always elect to turn around, sneak by, or prepare for the fight before
it happens. With enough foresight, a party may even turn the tables
on its opponents and surprise them, throwing the odds in their favor.
An ambush can only take place if the ambushing party is aware of
their victims’ presence and has managed to conceal their own.
Under most circumstances, this requires an Opposed Task Check
pitting the ambushers’ Stealth against their targets’ Awareness.
Each participant rolls separately. Though there are no Conditional
Modifiers by default, they can be assigned as needed if
circumstances or the difference in average Level between the two
groups seem like they would affect the outcome.
If the ambushers managed to beat their victims' rolls across the
board, the ambush is successful, and the first Round in the ensuing
battle will be a Preemptive Round. During this Round, only the
ambushing party is allowed to make Actions; roll for Initiative as
normal amongst the members of the attacking party, then assign
Actions. The victims of the ambush generate no Initiative during this
Round, and are afflicted with the Status Condition Unaware. After all
Actions have been resolved, the battle carries on as usual, with both
sides making Actions and rolling for Initiative.
If some members of the ambushed party managed to beat the
ambushers’ Stealth rolls but the majority remained unalerted, run a
Preemptive Round as normal. In this instance, any opponent whose
Awareness beat their ambushers’ Stealth rolls is exempt from being
Unaware during the Preemptive Round.
If the majority of the ambushed party managed to beat the
ambushers’ Stealth rolls but the ambushers still had enough time to
spring a surprise attack before their quarry could react, run a
Preemptive Round. All victims of the ambush are exempt from the
Unaware Condition.
If the ambushing party was completely unable to beat their
targets' rolls, battle proceeds as normal. No Preemptive Round is
run.
? Ambush in Action (1)
With Hiro and Kumani at their backs, Haze and Mint creep
through the dungeon complex, keeping a close ear open for
passing patrols.
Rodger (GM): This far up, you're beginning to glimpse the
scarcest glimmers of natural light filtering in from grilles in the
floor above, throwing little mosaics and patterns on the metal
underfoot. You can hear faint voices; the sound of weapons
rattling, of footsteps suggesting passing patrols.
M (Haze): As long as they stay above ground…
Rodger: Give me a roll for Awareness, both of you.
Blair (Mint): (rolling) 60.
M: (rolling) 42.
Rodger: There’s a dull rattle; chains being lowered, hidden
machinery in the wall ticking over just up ahead. Sounds like
there’s an elevator coming down further along the corridor.
Blair: Any chance we can get into position to attack before
they know we’re coming?
Rodger checks his notes. The elevator to the dungeon level is
closed; realistically speaking, the guards wouldn’t know they
were walking into an ambush until the doors opened. In this
case, the Stealth check can be waived in favor of a simple
Opposed Attribute Check.
Rodger: You’ll have to move fast. Attribute Checks against
Speed, please.
M: (rolling) 35.
Blair: (rolling) 18.
Rodger makes separate rolls for the three Guards coming
down the lift; Mint and Haze’s rolls beat all of them.
Rodger: You manage to reach the elevator cage a half-minute
before the heavy brass car slams into position. A mailed hand
closes around the wire mesh, pushing it back; the first guard
steps out, adjusting his visor—
Blair: We attack!
Rodger: The mechanoid barely has time to react before you
close in, weapons drawn. Preemptive Round – roll for
Initiatives.
? Ambush in Action (2)
M: (rolling) 3 plus Speed 8 equals 11.
Blair: (rolling) 7. …comes out to 15.
Rodger: Mint acts first, followed by Haze. Guards A, B and C
aren’t Unaware, but you’ve got surprise on your side. Blair,
what’s your action?
Blair: Mint’ll jump forward, trying to smack Guard A across the
face with her rod before he has a chance to go for his
weapon.
Rodger: All right. Roll to hit…
REINFORCEMENTS
Battles aren’t an invite-only affair; additional combatants may come
in on either side of the engagement during either the Initiative or
Action Phases, automatically joining a Party or Group in the process
if applicable. Reinforcements that enter during the Action Phase do
not generate Initiative, and cannot act until the following Round.
Depending on the circumstances, new arrivals may transform an
ongoing battle into a Pincer Attack – see below for more details.
? Reinforcements in Action
Two Rounds later, one Guard is down and another is on his
last legs. Suddenly, the elevator car begins to ascend…
Rodger (GM): …and that’s 14 damage to Guard C.
Deathsight's crony staggers back, the light in his visor
flickering erratically as he tries to steady himself. Mint’s about
to act when the loud rattle of chains being pulled taut
interrupts the proceedings; for a second time, the elevator car
has arrived at the dungeon level, searchlights flickering as the
cage slides open, revealing four more Guards.
Blair (Mint): They're coming in during the Action Phase? Are
they going to act this Round?
Rodger: No.
Blair: In that case, Mint’s going to bash the nearest new
arrival. Let’s see if we can’t even those odds a little bit…
PINCER ATTACKS
A Pincer Attack occurs when one side completely encircles the other.
As a result, the encircled combatants must split their attention
between multiple groups of opponents, potentially leaving them
open to an attack from behind. In-game, this is represented by
dividing the battle into two ‘faces’ – a Left Face and a Right Face,
roughly representing the two major flanks of the attack. The
example on the next page shows a party hemmed in by monsters:
Any combatant involved in a Pincer Attack must decide which facing
– Left or Right – they have. Switching facing from Left or Right – or
vice versa – is a Zero Action, but must be declared at the beginning
of a combatant's turn. Combatants in the encircled party may only
attack opponents who share their facing, while the encircling side
can attack either facing at will. Furthermore, whenever a combatant
in the encircling party attacks an opponent who does not share his
facing, that opponent is considered to be Unaware. To compensate,
the opponent may switch facing as a Reaction if they take damage
from a foe they are Unaware to.
Pincer Attacks last for as long as the encircling side keeps
combatants on both the Left and Right Faces. As soon as this stops
being the case, the Pincer Attack breaks up; combat proceeds as
normal.
? Pincer Attacks in Action
The Initiative Phase of Round 3 sees Haze and Mint trapped by
enemy reinforcements. The two prepare for a bitter struggle.
Rodger (GM): With six Guards and just two of you, you’re
completely surrounded. Give me facings; the six Guards – A, B, C,
D, E and F – are split evenly between the two.
M (Haze): I’ll face left, Mint will face right. That’ll at least give us
even odds.
Blair (Mint): Fine.
Rodger: All right. Roll for Initiatives.
M: (rolling) 4 plus Speed 8 equals 12.
Blair: (rolling) 2. …plus Speed 8 equals 10.
Rodger rolls Initiative for the Guards in secret, coming up with
Initiatives of 13, 7, 6, 14, 8 and 9.
Rodger: All right. Initiative order is as follows: Guard D, Guard A,
Haze, Mint, Guard F, Guard E, Guard B and Guard C.
Blair: …yeah, this is gonna hurt. A lot.
Rodger: (rolling) And they’re off! Guard D's visor flashes bright as
he slashes at Haze’s back; our favorite Dark Knight’s not facing
him, so he’s considered Unaware and takes double damage.
M: Wonderful. How bad is it?
Rodger: (rolling) Haze takes 9 damage, doubled to 18 for being
Unaware – do you want to change facing?
M: I’m staying the course here.
? Pincer Attacks in Action (2)
Rodger: (rolling) Good call – the wounded Guard A throws himself
at Haze before his comrade has even begun to step back. The
impact’s as much kinetic energy as surprise, damn near knocking
the air out of your lungs. (rolling) 7 damage, but you’re sharing his
facing, so no mods this time. Haze, you’re up.
Blair: May as well finish off Guard A while we’ve still got the chance.
M: Healing might be a better idea… I’m getting beat up something
fierce out here. Kumani and Hiro’d better get a move on.
TIMED BATTLES
Adding a time limit to a battle is a great way to ratchet up the
tension. More importantly, reasons for doing can vary dramatically –
the heroes may be trying to escape a collapsing palace, engaged in
a contest to subdue and defeat as many Ochus as they can in the
space of 10 minutes, or only have a scant half-hour before the
Empire’s Justice Tower takes out rebel headquarters.
When setting up a timed battle, the GM begins by establishing the
time limit. This will usually be in minutes, and ideally in increments of
5. Next, that limit is converted into 'ticks' by multiplying it by 60.
When a battle takes place, every Round that elapses in combat
reduces the total timer by a number of ticks equal to the Round’s
highest non-Extreme Initiative minus the lowest Initiative for that
Round. Intervening time, including travel and other activities
between battles, reduce the timer at the GM’s discretion. Should the
timer hit 0 before the heroes have accomplished their objective, it’s
game over.
Another way to run timed battles is to give the party a certain
amount of time during which they must hold out against attack. For
instance, the party may be defending a critical location against
opposing forces, and must hold their ground for at least 10 minutes
to give reinforcements time to arrive.
