## Level 1
**Burn Ray** - 7 MP  
Target: Single  
Type: Arcane (Magical)

The air around the target condenses, compressing into a tight ball
until it explodes. Burn Ray inflicts (4 x MAG) + d8, M. Armor Magical
damage.
**Hold** - 7 MP  
Target: Single  
Type: Status (Time)  
Reflect: Yes  
At the caster’s command, a globe of dull gray energy encloses the

**Escape** - 8 MP  
Target:   
SelfType: Support  
Reflect: No  
The caster winks out of existence, rematerializing a short distance
away a split-second later. Escape allows the caster to immediately
move (MAG x 2) meters in any direction of their choosing, passing
through any solid objects – such as walls – without ill effects.
However, the Escape will fail if the caster’s destination is inside a
solid structure or occupied by another person or object; in this case,
MP and time are still spent as normal. If used in combat, a
successful casting of Escape has effects equal to a successful
Escape Action.
**Tractor** - 10 MP  
Target: Single  
Type: Support  
Reflect: No  
Ruby rings of gravitational force shower down on the target,

force. Gravity has a CoS of (M. ACC - 50), M. Evasion of reducing the

or M. ARM, but is still subject to the Damage Cap.
**METEORITE** - 18 MP  
Target: Single  
Type: Arcane (Magical)

Prerequisite: Burn Ray
**REGEN** - 25 MP  
Target: Single  
Type: Status (Strengthen)  
Reflect: Yes  
Green motes shower down on the target, speeding up its natural
healing processes to grant the Status Condition Regen (6).
**RESET** - 30 MP  
Target: Single  
Type: Support  
Reflect: No  
A glittering globe of barely-suppressed temporal energy appears
over the target, capturing a few precious seconds of time ready to
be released at the caster’s beckoning. Until the end of the battle, the
target’s player may re-roll any one die roll once, keeping the more
favorable result of the two rolls. After this has been done, Reset’s
effects expire. The effects also expire if no reroll is made before the
end of combat, or if the combatant is targeted by Dispel or
Temporal Shirt. If cast on an opponent, the caster may choose which
roll to ‘reset’. Multiple castings of Reset do not increase the number
of rerolls available; the Spell will only have an effect if the target is
not already eligible for a reroll.
**Teleport** - 10 MP  
Target:   
PartyType: Support  
Reflect: No  
The air ripples, beginning to glow as the party dematerializes,
reappearing a distance away just seconds later. Targets affected by
Teleport immediately move (MAG x 5) meters in a direction of the
caster’s choosing, passing through any solid objects – such as walls
– without ill effects. However, the Teleport will fail if the caster’s
destination is inside a solid structure or occupied by another person
or object; in this case, MP and time are still spent as normal. If cast
in a multi-level or -story structure, Teleport will automatically move
the Party one level up or down; if used in combat, a successful
casting of Teleport has effects equal to a successful Escape Action
for all Party members.
Prerequisite: Escape
## Level 4
**COMET** - 44 MP  
Target:   
SpecialType: Arcane (Magical)  
Reflect: Yes  
The caster reaches towards the heavens, pulling a comet out of time
to crash down in a shower of fire and molten rock. When casting
Comet, roll a d% for each opponent on the battlefield twice; the
combatants with the highest rolls in each instance will be targeted by
the Spell. Make standard M. ACC rolls against both opponents’ M.
EVA scores to determine whether the Spell hits; each successful
strike inflicts (8 x MAG) + 2d8 Magical damage. If there is only one
eligible target, it will be struck twice for the listed damage.
Prerequisite: Meteorite
**DEMI** - 50 MP  
Target: Single  
Type: Status (Fatal)

An opaque gray sphere encloses the target; seconds later, crushing
gravitational forces compress, releasing the target only once the
sphere has shrunk to a speck of its former self. Demi has a CoS of
(M. ACC - 50), M. Evasion of reducing the target to 50% of its
current HP. This damage is not modified for ARM or M. ARM, but is

**EXIT** - 55 MP  
Target:   
PartyType: Support  
Reflect: No  
A wave of yellow light engulfs the party, dematerializing them to
reappear a distance away just seconds later. Targets affected by Exit
immediately move (MAG x 20) meters in a direction of the caster’s
choosing, passing through any solid objects – such as walls –
without ill effects. However, the Exit will fail if the caster’s destination
is inside a solid structure or occupied by another person or object;
in this case, MP and time are still spent as normal. If cast in a
dungeon or other large enclosed structure, Exit will automatically
move the Party to its entrance; if used in combat, a successful
casting of Exit has effects equal to a successful Escape Action for all
Party members.

Type: Arcane (Magical)  
Reflect: No  
The skies part, drawing down a searing shower of celestial debris
and radiation to bombard the battlefield. When casting Quasar, roll a
d% for each opponent on the battlefield four times; the combatants
with the highest rolls in each instance will be targeted by the Spell.
Make standard M. ACC rolls against all affected opponents’ M. EVA

Prerequisite: Slowga
**Temporal Shift** - 75 MP  
Target:   
AllType: Support  
Reflect: No  
In an instant, the caster is surrounded by ring after ring of
translucent clocks, circling in a slow pattern before speeding up and
shattering. The glittering debris hovers in mid-air for a moment,
drawing the lines of an ethereal clock face before winking out of
existence. Temporal Shift cancels all Time-type Status Conditions
currently active on the battlefield, negative or otherwise.
## Level 7
**WarP** - 100 MP  
Target:   
PartyType: Support  
Reflect: No  
Energy ripples around the caster and their allies as they wink out of
existence, reappearing an instant later many miles away. Warp must
be cast twice in order to be effective; the first time it is cast, an
arcane circle of energy forms around the caster, marking the
immediate area before fading away – this is the Time Mage’s Home
Point, whose location should be noted at the time the Spell is cast.
The second time Warp is cast, the caster – and all allies in the
immediate area – are teleported back to the Home Point, regardless
of how much distance separates their current location with the
Home Point. If this effect is used in combat, it has effects equal to a
successful Escape Action for all Party members. Once the Party
arrives back at the Home Point, the arcane circle winks out of
existence; to set a new Home Point, Warp must be cast again.
Prerequisite: Exit
**QUICKEN** - 103 MP  
Target: Single  
Type: Support  
Reflect: No  
The target blurs as it slides sideways in time, seeing the battlefield
frozen in its tracks for a brief moment. Quicken’s target may make
an Action as soon as the Spell is cast, even if they have already used
their allotment of Actions for the Round or are currently resolving an
Action with a Charge Time. Taking this Action will not count towards
their limit of Actions for the Round; if the chosen Action has a
Charge Time, resolve it immediately and subtract the Charge Time
from the combatant’s current Initiative count.
**RETURN** - 85 MP  
Target:   
PartyType: Support  
Reflect: No  
The battlefield seems to fold up as time is compressed and enclosed
in a glowing globe that continually replays captured moments on its
rippling surface. Until the end of combat, the caster and all allies on
the battlefield may each re-roll any one die roll they make, keeping
the more favorable of the two; after this has been done, Return’s
effects expire for them. The effects also expire if no reroll is made
before end of the battle, or if a combatant under the effects of
Return is targeted by Temporal Shift or Dispel.
Prerequisite: Reset
**SHOCKWAVE PULSAR** - 100 MP  
Target: Group  
Type: Magical  
Reflect: Yes  
Gravity suddenly ceases to function as a glowing sphere of stellar

and heat. Shockwave Pulsar inflicts (27 x MAG) + 4d12, M. Armor
Magical damage on all targets.
Prerequisite: Flare Star
X-**ZONE** - 125 MP

50), M. Evasion of Ejecting all eligible targets into the Cleft of

roll separately for each target. Anything targeted by the Spell may
voluntarily choose to travel to the Cleft; if so, no roll is necessary.

## Level 8
**BLACK HOLE** - 150 MP

A spinning vortex of gravitational energy forms above the battlefield,
crackling as it begins to direct crushing pressure on the target.

target to 10% of its current HP. This damage is not modified for ARM
or M. ARM, and may exceed the Damage Cap.
Prerequisite: Quarter
**CeLestial STasis** - 125 MP  
Target: Group  
Type: Status (Time)  
Reflect: Yes  
A hazy clock face shimmers into existence across the battlefield,
hands shuddering as they begin to slow, eventually stopping dead.
For a moment, the second hand wavers, almost seeming to move
backwards before the clock explodes in a shower of fragments.
Celestial Stasis has a CoS of (M. ACC - 50), M. Evasion of inflicting
the Status Condition Stop upon all targets (4).
Prerequisite: Stop
**METEOR** - 200 MP  
Target: Group  
Type: Arcane (Magical)  
Reflect: No  
With a single motion, the caster splits the skies above the battlefield
to reveal the stars and planets beyond – and a single fiery meteor
hurtling towards the battlefield below, crashing down in a shower of
rock and flame. When casting Meteor, roll a d% for each opponent
on the battlefield six times; the combatants with the highest rolls in
each instance will be targeted by the Spell. Make standard M. ACC
rolls against all affected opponents’ M. EVA scores to determine
whether the Spell hits; each successful strike inflicts (8 x MAG) +
2d8 Magical damage. If there is only one eligible target, it will be
struck six times for the listed damage.
Prerequisite: Quasar
**OLD** - 100 MP  
Target: Single  
Type: Status (Weak)

conditions Agility Break (4), Armor Break (4), Magic Break (4),
Mental Break (4), Power Break (4) and Spirit Break (4).
Prerequisite: Time Slip
**QUICK** - 200 MP  
Target:   
SelfType: Support  
Reflect: No  
A translucent clock encases the caster, creating a pocket of localized
time for a few precious seconds before shattering. Quick allows the
caster to make two Actions as soon as the Spell is cast; if the Actions
have a Charge Time, it is ignored. In addition, casting Quick a second
time while under the influence of Quick brings the caster back into
normal time, canceling the effects of both Spells. After the second
Action has been taken, the caster’s Initiative drops to 0, regardless
of whether or not the caster would normally be eligible to make
additional Actions.
Prerequisite: Hastega
