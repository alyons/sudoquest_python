Magic is a fundamental and natural part of the world, manifest in all
things animate and inanimate. The flow of magical energy, or mana,
in the world as a whole is essential to its well-being; only so long as
the power of the elements is unchecked can the wind continue to
blow, the earth continue to be fertile, the cycle of life and death go
on. All of the world's inhabitants, whether conscious of it or not,
have some small part of this force inside them; with training, it can
be turned into a weapon more powerful than mere blade or brawn,
more devastating than all but the farthest-reaching technologies.  
Most worlds contain at least some degree of ‘background magic’
– enough mana to sustain life on the world itself, but a far cry from
the sheer amount of free energy needed to fuel true spellcasting.
The existence of Mages depends heavily on the presence of objects
that reinforce and amplify this weak level of natural magic to the
point where it can be actively shaped.

### Magicite
Certain kinds of naturally-occurring crystals have been found to be
curiously sympathetic to the flow of mana, able to focus, store and
even amplify natural elemental forces. Such crystals are known as
magicite, and can vary widely in both size and power. At its smallest,
magicite can be little more than a microscopic powder trapped within
larger rock formations, creating unusual phenomena through pentup
mana. A stone charged with a modest amount of Fire energy, for
instance, would feel unusually warm to the touch, though its
sorcerous uses are next to nil. Conversely, genuinely titanic magicite
formations such as the legendary Four Crystals are magical
reservoirs without peer, capable of raising and destroying nations
with equal ease.  
Magicite can be used for any number of purposes, ranging from
powering machinery to enriching soil. Most magically-empowered
equipment is constructed by binding the rush of energy freed by the
destruction of magicite fragments into the item during the creation
process; more powerful arms and armor may be made of pure
magicite crystals, and are capable of absorbing and channeling
significant amounts of magical power.

### Battle Items
Almost all creatures have some amount of magicite in their bodies,
allowing them to channel mana for their own uses. Upon death, part
of the magical energy that has passed through the creature may
linger in its magicite; parts of the creature that have particularly
high concentrations of magicite can even be harvested to make a
Battle Item. Such ‘frozen’ magic is typically more common in the
remains of creatures of arcane origin, such as Bombs; virtually any
fragment of their bodies can be used to unleash a small spark of
offensive spellcasting in the right hands.

### Ecologies of Magic
Even as it sustains life, magic in turn creates its own ecology,
ranging in scale from animal-like nature spirits to the primitive
elementals, creatures 'birthed' by large masses of elemental energy
converging on a single location. At the tip of the proverbial totem
pole are the Summons, known by a million and one names
throughout the universe; such creatures typically dwell on planes of
pure power connected to a world by only the most tenuous of links,
drawn into material existence by the persuasive talents of Caller and
Summoner alike.  
The environment, too, interacts with raw flows of magic,
resonating where the elements are most sympathetic. The heat of a
volcano, for instance, can tie together many streams of Fire
Elemental energy, creating a reservoir of mana favorable to arcane
creatures and spellcasters alike. Similarly, a lightning strike during a
ferocious thunderstorm attracts Lightning Elemental energy; a
torrential rainfall leads to the accumulation of Water Elemental
power. For those who rely on the might of the elements, careful
consideration of one’s surroundings is an important factor in
effectively shaping these energies.

### Spellcasters
Active wielders of magical power vary wildly in shape and scope.
With sufficient training and physical discipline, warriors can channel
elemental flows into their techniques; to them, this force is known as
chi and accounts for much of their power in battle. However, such
applications are rigid, depending as much on the warrior’s physical
prowess as on their awareness of the magical basis underlying
them. A true Mage can actively twist and focus raw flows of magic
into physical, visible forms; dark mists, freezing gales, howling
storms, and scorching waves of fire.  
The spellcasting procedure itself depends on the power and
experience of the mage in question. Beginners rely heavily on subvocalized
incantations to focus the power necessary to unleash their
Spell of choice; more advanced practitioners can invoke magic with
nothing more than a simple hand-gesture. Once prepared, all Spells
can be activated by a spoken word – usually the spell's name , such
as 'Cura!' – or a more grandiose command, such as "Star fire,
awaken and deliver your judgment! Firaga!” However, it should be
noted that such pronouncements are usually delivered more for
intimidation value than actual practicality; in both cases, the results
are the same.  
Casting magic also has a visual aspect, as mana drawn by casters
from the immediate environment solidifies into motes of light just
before entering the caster's body. How noticeable this is depends on
both the power of the caster and the amount of mana required by
the Spell; particularly adept magicians can disguise these 'mana
signatures' to make even high-intensity spellcasting effectively
invisible.

### The Elements of Magic
The classification of magic has occupied scholars for centuries. Even
to this day, the finer details of magical taxonomy can be fuel for
considerable debate. Certain aspects, however, are considered to be
universally agreed on. Among them is the fact that mana is the basic
building-block of magic; though further diversified and refined, raw
mana can be used to drive a wide variety of helpful and harmful
effects. From here, all magic can be broadly broken up into three
major groups of forces – Elemental, Cosmic and Life.  
The Elemental forces are sometimes also called ‘natural forces’,
deriving that designation from the fact that they are inextricably tied
to natural phenomena. The most common of these involve the four
basic elements – Earth, Fire, Wind and Water – which in turn
combine to form the distinctive ‘para-elements’ of Lightning and Ice.
To these are added Bio, Holy and Shadow. The inclusion of the latter
two is problematic for those who see them as supernatural rather
than mundane forces. As a result, in some quarters the latter three
are not considered elements at all, and simply excised from the
reckoning. The collective grouping of these nine – Earth, Fire, Air,
Water, Lightning, Ice, Bio, Holy and Shadow – is referred to as the
Combat Elements; spells focusing their power are intended for harm
and destruction more often than not.  
Outside the domain of the elements is the force of Cosmos; its
components are Time and Gravity, the distortion of which forms the
basis of the Time Mage’s curious powers. In many cases, the end
result is a roundabout way of accomplishing what elemental magic
will easily do in skilled hands; rather than launch a fireball, a Time
Mage will twist the forces of Time and pluck a comet shower from
distant antiquity just long enough to bombard their opponents into
submission.  
The final component of the magical spectrum is another
overarching force, Life, given power by the cycle of birth and death
and the migration of souls. Though not inherently a magical thing, its
interactions with raw magic have allowed White Mages and other
practitioners of healing to use it in the same fashion as its wilder
elemental counterparts. As a result, its inclusion remains a point of
contention.

## Spell Classifications
For the sake of clarifying effects and offering an organizational
thread to tie various Spells together, each Spell belongs to a
distinctive category.

### Elemental Magic
Elemental Magic is a term used to describe any Spell that deals
damage associated with one of the nine Combat Elements.

### Arcane Magic
Any Spell that directly deals damage to an opponent but is not
affiliated with a Combat Elements belongs to the category of Arcane
Magic. Arcane Magic can deal either Physical or Magical damage;
which of the two is noted in the 'Type' field.

### Recovery Magic
Recovery Magic describes any Spell that recovers HP or MP to a
target – usually the caster, or one of the caster's allies – or removes
negative Status Conditions. Recovery Magic can have unexpected
effects on Undead monsters – and combatants afflicted with the
Status Condition Zombie.

### Status Magic
Any Spell that inflicts one or more Status Conditions as a result of its
casting, beneficial or otherwise, is known as Status Magic. For the
sake of calculating Immunities, these Spells are divided into seven
categories – Mystify, Toxin, Seal, Time, Transform, Fatal, and Weak –
based on the Status Conditions they inflict. There are also two
positive Status Categories, Barrier and Strengthen.

### Support Magic
Support Magic covers Spells that do not have a direct effect on
either the caster, the caster’s allies, or their opponents. The Spell
Sight, which allows a White Mage to get an overview of an area, is a
prime example of this kind of magic.

### Spellblade Magic
Spellblade Magic is the specialized category of magic used by Magic
Knights and their ilk. Rather than directly affecting opponents, such
Spells instead use the caster’s weapon as a conduit.

## Spell List

Each category of magic has a page dedicated to it's spell list (save Red Magic which has a table listing all of the spells here).

### Black Magic
Black is the color of destruction. Practitioners of Black Magic have
mastered control of the elements, shaping these into any number of
offensive devices.

### White Magic

The power of White is that of life itself. As a foil to the destructive
excesses of Black Magic, White Magic heals where Black injures,
protects where Black weakens. White Mages are restricted in terms
of direct offense, but their support ability is second to none.

### Time Magic

Sometimes referred to as 'Cosmic Magic' or 'Effect Magic', Time
Magic derives its power from the manipulation and distortion of both
space and time.

### Red Magic

A utilitarian blending of various schools of magic, Red Magic picks a
wide variety of spells from Black, White, and Time Magic for
unparalleled flexability on the battlefield.

Red Magic Spells by Level

| Spell Level | Spells |
|:-----------:|--------|
|1|Aero, Blind, Blizzard, Cure, Fire, Poison, Poisona, Scan, Sleep, Thunder|
|2|Berserk, Blink, Element Spikes, Float, Lock, Rasp, Slow, Stona, Water|
|3|Aerora, Blizzara, Cura, Fira, Immobilize, Protect, Regen, Silence, Thundara, Zombie|
|4|Basuna, Bio, Confuse, Dispel, Drain, Haste, Osmose, Raise, Ruse, Shell, Slowga, Watera|
|5|Aeroga, Blizzaga, Curaga, Disable, Firaga, Mini, Protectga, Stone, Thundaga, Time Slip|
|6|Charm, Esuna, Flare, Hastega, Quake, Syphon, Shellga, Stop, Waterga, Vanish|
|7|Arise, Freeze, Nuke, Pain, Reflect, Renew, Toad, Wall, Venom|
|8|Break, Meltdown, Meteor, Old, Shield, Whirlwind|

_Note that the Red Magic version of Meteor and Haste do not have
Quasar or Speed as a prerequisite, as those spells are not on the
Red Magic list. All other spell prerequisites must be met as normal
when picking Red Magic spells._

### Blue Magic

Not all magic in the world originates from human hands. Monsters
and other creatures of magical origin practice their own unique
brand of innate spellcraft, unleashing devastating magical energies
almost as a reflex.

### Spellblade Magic

Spellblade Magic is a close cousin to Black Magic, storing Black’s
destructive powers in a weapon wielded by the caster, to be released
upon contact with an opponent. While the use of the weapon as a
conduit allows such spells to be cast with relative ease when
compared to their ‘pure’ counterparts, a considerable amount of
weapons skill is required to maximize this advantage.

### Intuitive Magic

In Final Fantasy, most magic is heavily regimented, divided into set
groups of Spells with explicit effects that never change. This does
not mean that there is no room for creativity, however – on the
contrary, by drawing on their experience, veteran casters can create
all manner of cantrips, illusions, and other sorcerous miscellanea. In
the FFRPG, such magic is known as Intuitive Magic.
