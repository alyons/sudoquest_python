title: "Intuitive Magic Rules"
---

## Basic Rules

Intuitive Magic is subject to several important restrictions. These
are:
- **No Intuitive effect can directly inflict or recover damage and Status Conditions, or mimic the mechanical effects of an existing Spell.** This
does not mean the effect's ultimate outcome must always be
harmless; using Intuitive magic to startle a soldier and send him
falling over a parapet will still result in damage, albeit indirectly.
- **A spellcaster can only create Intuitive magic in line with the Spells he or she would normally be able to cast.** A Black Mage, for instance,
would not be able to create a blast of air to knock a treasure chest
from a high pedestal, nor would a White Mage be able to create a
fiery explosion in mid-air. To make this simpler for both the players
and the GM, all Jobs with the ability to use Intuitive Magic or
comparative powers have a list of keywords in Chapter 4. In order to
be cast, the desired effect must be in line with one or more of these
keywords.
- **Spells cast through Intuitive magic are still Spells.** If the character
is unable to cast Spells as a result of Status Conditions or other
extraordinary circumstances, Intuitive magic is similarly off-limits.
- **Intuitive Magic cannot be used more than once per Scene.**
Creating a new magic effect is often an involved process, and
requires a brief 'cooldown' period between Spells.

## Creating an Intuitive Effect

Because Intuitive effects are open-ended in nature, the rules to
create them are relatively simple – most of the 'heavy lifting'
involved in their creation relies on GM and player judgment.

### DESCRIBE THE EFFECT

Whenever a player wishes to create an Intuitive effect, they must
begin by explaining what exactly they want to achieve. Legitimate
examples might include things like “Reshape the columns into a
stairway leading to the next level,” “Create a bridge from the
surrounding plants and creepers that will carry the party across the
chasm,” “Transfer enough mana to the Skystone to get the airship
off the ground,” or “Create a spectacular bang!” Before approving
the effect, the GM should make sure that what the player is trying to
achieve can't be readily done with an existing Spell and that the
effect is in line with the keywords given for the player's Job. Effects
that do not fall into any particular magical domain – as with the last
two examples given above – do not have to conform to a specific
keyword.

### DETERMINE THE MP COST

The next step is to assign an MP cost to the effect. This will be
determined by how large an object or area it affects when cast – the
larger the scale, the higher the MP cost. While an effect's MP cost is
entirely left to the GM's discretion, the table below gives appropriate
ballpark figures for various size grades.

|SIZE OF ITEM OR AREA AFFECTED|MP COST|
|-----------------------------|:-----:|
|Small rock |2|
|Average-sized rock| 8|
|Child, Moogle, Tarutaru| 15|
|Human |30|
|Ogre, Gigas| 50|
|Small house| 80|
|Large house| 100|
|Skyscraper| 200|
|City block| 400|

### DETERMINE THE MODIFIER

Once the effect's cost has been established, the next thing on the list
is its difficulty – or to be precise, the Conditional Modifer imposed on
the player's M. Accuracy when rolling to see whether the effect
succeeds. This is determined by its complexity, or overall
sophistication. The more elaborate the intended effect, the lower the
ultimate CoS will be. Again, while this is left to the GM's discretion, a
number of sample modifiers have been given below.

| COMPLEXITY | MODIFIER |
|------------|:--------:|
|Creating a bright flash |-20|
|Creating a crude illusion |-20|
|Using telekinesis to move an object |-40|
|Creating a modest illusion |-60|
||-80|
|Creating a sophisticated illusion |-100|
||-120|
||-140|
|Reshaping the immediate environment |-160|

### MAKING THE ROLL
To complete the effect, the caster must make a Task Check against
their Magic Accuracy, subtracting the modifier assigned for the
effect's complexity. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may
also assign additional modifiers; some examples are given below. If
the roll succeeds, the player achieves the desired effect; if the roll
fails, the Magic Points have been wasted.

**Conditional Modifiers**  
Effect's scale larger than a human: **-20**  
Effect's scale larger than small house: **-40**  
Elaborate, hour-long rituals performed beforehand: **+20**  
Working against weak enchantments: **0**  
Working against competent enchantments: **-20**  
Working against elaborate enchantments: **-40**  
Working against masterful enchantments: **-80**  

### CASTING CIRCLES

In magic, as in all other things, two heads are often better than one.
Intuitive Magic can benefit from the Groupwork rules from Chapter 5,
provided that all other participants have the appropriate Intuitive
Magic ability.

## Sample Intuitive Effects

**Medeo** - 15 MP  
Effect: A classic example of stage magic. Medeo mimics the effects
of the Time Spell Meteor, summoning an asteroid fragment to crash
into the target with a devastating explosion. Unlike its 'genuine'
counterpart, Medeo is all sound and fury, doing no damage; the
pyrotechnics produced, however, are indistinguishable from the real
thing. Medeo is cast at a CoS of (M. ACC - 60).
