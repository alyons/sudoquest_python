## Character Build Walkthrough

Valiant, cryptic, insightful, vain – the characters of the FFRPG are a
diverse lot, hailing from gilded halls and broken homes alike. All
have one thing in common, however: they began life in this very
chapter. The following pages cover the creation and development of
FFRPG characters using the sheets in Appendix V, breaking things
down into a sequence of nine steps for an easier overview. Though
the process can seem daunting at first, time and experience should
make it close to second nature.

> **Generating a Character (1)**  
To illustrate the character creation process in a little more
detail, these example sections following each step show how a
typical character might be generated.  
Carl has recently been invited to Rodger’s game and has to
generate an appropriate character in time for the next session.
While he’s played in a number of FFRPG games in the past, he
still follows the same

_Author's Note: It is not wholy necessary to have a fully realized character concept at this point in character creation. Work with your table and feel free to build as you go, and come back to sections as you can to finish out your character._

### 01. Concept

The easiest way to begin creating a character is to start with a
broad, fairly basic concept – 'neurotic spellcaster,' ‘crude
mercenary,’ 'narcissistic wandering thief' – and then flesh that idea
out piece by piece by adding details. Sometimes the concept will be
dictated or limited by the game’s setting; the GM may also have
specific ideas for the characters. For this reason, it is best to run
your concepts by the GM to ensure they fit – or get their advice on
where you can take the concept once it’s approved. Once this is
done, the next things to consider are:

**Name:** In a universe populated by heroes with monikers like Cloud
Strife, Zidane Tribal or Laguna Loire, a good name can go a long way
towards making a character seem like a plausible addition to
Square's established mythos. Ideally, a good name should be
evocative and a little unusual; a Dragoon calling himself 'Bob Smith'
is clearly neither. Specific naming pointers are given with the racial
descriptions in Chapter 3.

**Age:** Age nearly always equates to 'experience.' Older characters
will usually have been around the block a few times, while younger
characters are more impetuous and naive about the world at large.
Final Fantasy heroes tend to be younger, sometimes excessively so;
for Humans, the late teens are generally prime world-saving years.

Though both are viable options, extremely young and old
characters are likely to face serious social discrimination in-game;
due to their age, few will be inclined to take them seriously, while
comments like 'old-timer' and 'squirt' are almost guaranteed to
follow them everywhere they go.

**Appearance:** A character's physical features, height, weight, build,
hair-, eye- and skin color all help define them, but appearance is
about more than physical attributes – it's about style. Consider
clothing: does the character lean towards all-concealing black
trenchcoats, or a wardrobe consisting entirely of loud pastels? What
about jewelry, or other distinguishing features such as tattoos? How
does the character carry themselves, and what impression do the
character's general posture and expression give others?

> **Generating a Character (2)**  
Given that there's only one 'fighter-type' in Rodger’s group,
Carl’s decides a Mithra martial artist would be a good addition
to the party. With Rodger in favor, Carl begins building his
heroine in earnest.  
**Name:** The Mithra naming notes suggest that Mithra
characters will have names with a Thai or Indonesian flavor.
Carl chooses to name his character Kumani Bersihdarah.  
**Age:** Carl wants his character to strike a balance between
youth and experience. Checking the age ranges given for
Mithra, Carl gives her an age of 19.  
**Appearance:** Carl envisions Ku as lithe, muscular and tanned
from a life of living outdoors; the constant exposure to the sun
has bleached her hair to almost-pure white. To avoid having
her movements impeded in combat, Ku’s clothing is restricted
to a set of thick-soled sandals, thigh-length leather shorts,
and a heavy leather combat vest covering a smaller
undershirt. Her hair is tied in a long braid that reaches down
to her waist; the end is wrapped around a bright pink iron ball
usable as a weapon in emergencies. A branding of three
crescent moons arranged in a circle can be seen on her left
cheek.

**Background:** The past helps make the present understandable.
For this reason, a character's history is an important consideration
– it defines who they are and why they act the way they do.
Obviously, the chosen setting will define a lot of the small details, but
even broad backgrounds should furnish biographical detail, listing
defining moments in the character's life – the murder of a friend or
mentor, the tragic loss of a family member, achieving a knighthood
or being drafted into the service of a great mage. These ‘hooks’
offer GMs a means to easily integrate the player’s background into
games; details such as birthplace, education, and upbringing can
also help to add further definition.

**Personality:** A character’s personality defines their reaction to and
interaction with the world around them – in short, how the character
deals with the situations they encounter over the course of their
adventures. It may be easier to organize personality by extremes –
are they hot-headed risk takers, or cautious and patient? Does
injustice offend them because they have a strict code of morals, or
because they want a cut of the action? – but playing things too
broadly risks turning the character into a stereotype.

> **Generating a Character (3)**  
**Background:** Carl envisions ‘Ku’ as a traditional Mithra
fishergirl who abandoned the family trade after a nasty
encounter with a sea-snake, traveling to a distant human city
in search of a living. Like many who do so, she found nothing
much beyond poverty. Desperate for money, she became a pit
fighter, quickly establishing a reputation as a force to be
reckoned with. Her trademark became her 'miracle
comebacks' – watching her opponent carefully, she could learn
their moves and mirror them, returning the favor in kind.
Training in the wilds, she learned to mimic monsters as well as
humans, speeding her ascent in the fighting circuits – until the
day she lost control of her power and killed an opponent.
Forced to flee, she began wandering once more, searching for
more clues to the mysterious abilities that had made her a
champion – and a murderer.  
**Personality:** While once gregarious, Ku has matured through
the adversity she has encountered, though not at the expense
of her positive nature. Serenity is also one of her hallmarks;
years of careful mental discipline have hardened Ku to almost
ice-cold calm in the face of danger.
However, she is not perfect. Ku hides her magical powers
because she fears what others will do in reaction, greatly
exaggerating her knowledge of the martial arts to do so.

**Possessions:** Beyond their equipment, a character may have a few
items of purely sentimental or personal value – a signet ring passed
down from generation to generation, a necklace or locket given to
them from a loved one, a lucky coin or talisman. This section of the
sheet is used to describe these.

**Goals:** Goals are the character's major aspirations in life; whether
it's something as selfish as wanting to claim the title of 'world's
greatest treasure hunter' or a noble cause like or bringing peace to
their war-torn home country. Whatever else may happen, the
character's goals will ultimately guide their actions and decisions in
the world.

**A Quote:** An example saying of your character’s. Optional, but just
as effective at establishing them as any number of descriptive
paragraphs. This can be anything from an often overused
catchphrase (“…Whatever.”) to a short and pithy comment typical
of the character's general outlook on life (“You thought a little thing
like the end of the world was gonna do me in?”).

> **Generating a Character (4)**  
**Possessions:** Aside from her equipment, Ku carries around
little of value.  
**Goals:** Ku seeks to distinguish herself as a fighter and further
her understanding of her powers.  
**A Quote:** “Harap maaf, but you’rrre going to have to taste
backfist now."

### 02. Race

Humans make up the standard population of most worlds, but not
every hero will be human – depending on the setting and
circumstances, characters may belong to one of the other races
detailed in Chapter Three. Playing a non-human character can have
both obvious and less obvious repercussions; the most immediate
effect, however, will be on the character's potential Attributes.

> **Generating a Character (5)**
Carl already decided to play a Mithra character when he first
drew up Kumani. All that's left for him to do is note how this
will affect her Attributes

### 03. Job

A character's chosen Job determines his or her basic Abilities, their
starting Hit and Magic Points, and a whole slew of other factors. For
this reason, choosing a Job is possibly the most important decision a
player makes during the character creation process. Classes and
Jobs are presented in full detail in Chapter 4.
> **Generating a Character (6)**  
Carl browses through the available Jobs, looking for something
to fit his concept. Though the Monk would be the most
immediately obvious choice for Carl, Ku’s mysterious power
strikes him as a better fit for the Mimic or Blue Mage
professions. Carl settles on Blue Mage.

### 04. Attributes

Now we begin to define a character’s mechanical aspects. Every
starting character has a total of 40 Attribute Points to divide
between the six Attributes – Strength, Vitality, Agility, Speed, Magic,
and Spirit – as the player chooses, provided that at least 1 point is
spent on each Attribute. Attribute Points are spent at a one-to-one
ratio. By placing 6 Attribute Points in Strength, for example, a
character would start with a Strength rating of 6. Any Attribute
Points not spent at character creation do not carry over into the
game, and are lost.
Choice of race can have an impact on how these Points are spent,
as all races have Racial Maximums for each Attribute. No starting
character may begin the game with any Attribute’s rating exceeding
their race’s allowed maximum. For instance, ordinary Human
characters can have a maximum starting Strength of 10, no greater.
Racial Maximums are further modified by the character’s choice of
Job, but this bonus is not applied during character creation. In
practical terms, this means that Racial Maximums may only be
exceeded if the character gains more Attribute Points during the
course of the game.
> **Generating a Character (7)**  
The first thing Carl makes a note of is the Mithra statline,
which gives him the following range of Racial Maximums:
>
> | Str | Vit | Agi | Spd | Mag | Spr |
> |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
> | 9   | 9   | 12  | 12  | 9   | 9   |
>
> Carl starts defining Ku’s Attributes by assigning 4 Points to each Attribute as a ‘base’, leaving him with 16 Attribute Points
to spend. As a fist-fighter as well as a spellcaster, Kumani’s
most developed Attributes will be Strength, Vitality, Speed, and
Magic; Carl raises STR and AGI to 6 and 5 and MAG and SPD to
9 and 8 respectively, giving him 4 more points to spend on
boosting VIT and SPR. Kumani’s final Attribute distribution runs
as follows:
>
> | Str | Vit | Agi | Spd | Mag | Spr |
> |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
> | 6   | 5   | 5   | 8   | 9   | 7   |

### 05. Advantages and Disadvantages

Characters differ in more than just profession and personality.
Physical edges and ailments, unconventional training and innate
resistance to attacks can all enhance a character’s combat ability;
conversely, physical ailments and other difficulties diminish it. In
game terms, these are expressed through Advantages and
Disadvantages. Though only available at the GM's discretion, they
offer a number of ways to further personalize a character.  
Each of the Advantages and Disadvantages presented over the
next few pages has a specific point cost assigned to it; Advantages
have a positive cost, while Disadvantages have a negative one. If a
GM allows a player to buy Advantages and Disadvantages during
character creation, their combined cost of must be less than or
equal to 0. No more than 10 Points of Advantages may be taken,
and no Advantage or Disadvantage may be taken more than once
unless this is explicitly permitted in its description. Even if an
Advantage or Disadvantage has multiple effects with separate point
costs, only one of these effects may be taken by default.  

The page for [Advantages and Disadvantages](/ffrpg325/part1/advantages-disadvantages/) contains information about all of the available choices one can make when creating their character.

> **Generating a Character (8)**  
To round off Kumani's personality, Carl gives her the
Disadvantages Vulnerability (Toxin) and Elemental Deficiency
(Bio) to represent the after-effects of the childhood encounter
that swore her off fishing for life. This allows him to buy 5
Points’ worth of Advantages, so he picks up the 3-Point
version of Signature Weapon for Kumani’s Gloves and Combat
Reflexes, giving her a little extra edge in battle.

### 06. Equipment

Characters can spend up to 500 Gil on purchasing essential supplies
and equipment during character creation. Chapter 6 has full listings
for the various types of Weapons, Armor, Items, and Accessories
available for purchase. All starting purchases must have an
Availability Rating of 91% or higher. Any money not spent on
starting equipment is given to the character as starting money at a
ratio of 1 to 1. A character’s Job will also impose restrictions on
what kinds of items they can use – consult the Job's profile in
Chapter 4 for more details.

> **Generating a Character (9)**  
Carl’s first priority is a weapon. As a Blue Mage, Kumani is
limited to a handful of potential weapons; scanning these, Carl
decides the most appropriate choice would be Gloves. 75 G is
spent on Leather Gloves; a Leather Plate (110 G), Leather
Gauntlets (65 G) and a Cap (80 G) leave her with 170 G to
spend on other Items and Accessories. Carl buys two Tonics
(50 G total) and a Tincture (75 G) and carries the remaining
45 G over as starting money.

### 07. Combat Statistics

While a player cannot directly spend Attribute Points to modify
Combat Statistics, they can indirectly influence them through their
Attributes. The eight Statistics are generated as follows:  
**Hit Points (HP):** All Jobs have a Hit Die given in their profiles – a
Black Mage, for instance, has a Hit Die of d6. In order to generate
the character’s starting HP, just roll the indicated die, add 30 to the
result, then add the character’s VIT value. The total is the number of
Hit Points the character will have upon starting the game.  
**Magic Points (MP):** All Magic-using Jobs will have a specific Magic
Die listed in their profile. As with the Hit Die, roll this, add 10 to the
result, and then add the character’s SPR value to get the total
number of Magic Points the character starts the game with. If the
character’s chosen Job does not have a Magic Die, skip this step.
They will always have 0 MP, regardless of their SPR.  
**Evasion (EVA):** A character's Evasion rating is calculated by
adding together their AGI and SPD, then adding any bonuses
conferred by equipment.  
**Magic Evasion (M. EVA):** M. Evasion is calculated by adding
together a character's SPR and MAG, then adding any bonuses
conferred by equipment.  
**Armor (ARM):** A character’s Armor rating is calculated by adding
together the ARM values of every piece of armor the character has
equipped, then applying the modifier given for the character's VIT in
the table below to the total. The result is the character’s final ARM.  
**Magic Armor (M. ARM):** This statistic is calculated by adding
together the M. ARM values of every piece of armor equipped by the
character, then applying the modifier given for the character's SPR in
table below to the total to find the character’s final M. ARM.

**Table: ARM and M. ARM Bonuses**

|CHARACTER'S VIT/SPR ARM / M. ARM|MODIFIER|
|:------------------------------:|:------:|
|1 - 2 |+5%|
|3 - 4|+10%|
|5 - 6 |+15%|
|7 - 8 |+20%|
|9 - 10 |+25%|
|11 - 12 |+30%|
|13 - 14 |+35%|
|15 - 16| +40%|
|17 - 18| +45%|
|19 - 20| +50%|
|21 - 22| +55%|
|23 - 24 |+60%|
|25 - 26 |+65%|
|27 - 28 |+70%|
|29 - 30 |+75%|

**Dexterity (DEX):** DEX is calculated via the formula:
Level + (AGI x 2) + 50  
**Mind (MND):** Mind is calculated via the formula:
Level + (MAG x 2) + 50  
**Accuracy (ACC):** ACC is calculated via the formula:
Level + (AGI x 2) + Job's Attack Bonus + Weapon Skill  
The Weapon Skill used in the formula is the one required by the
currently equipped Weapon – Swords for Greatswords, Cudgels for
Rods, Guns for Rifles, and so forth.  
**Magic Accuracy (M. ACC):** M. ACC is calculated via the formula:
Level + (MAG x 2) + 100.  
**Expertise (EXP):** Used only for Expert Jobs. Expertise is calculated
via the formula:  
(Expert Skill / 2) + Level + (Skill's Default Attribute x 2)
except for the Engineer, which uses the following formula:  
(Invent Rating / 2) + Level + (AGI x 2)
For all Expert Jobs, the applicable Expert Skill will be listed in the
Job's profile.

> **Generating a Character (11)**  
Now that Attributes and Equipment have been determined,
Combat Statistics are next on the list.
Hit Points: Checking the Blue Mage profile, Carl finds that
Kumani will have a Hit Die of d8. Rolling this gives him a 6;
added to Kumani’s VIT of 5 and the base of 30, this means
Kumani starts the game with 41 HP.
Magic Points: Blue Mages also have a Magic Die of d8. Carl
rolls again and comes up with a 4. Added to her SPR of 7 and
the base of 10, this gives Kumani 21 MP to start out with.
Evasion: Kumani’s Evasion is equal to her SPD of 8 plus her
AGI of 5, or 13.
Armor: The Leather Plate, Leather Gauntlets and Cap have
ARM ratings of 5, 2, and 1 respectively, for a total of 8. As
Kumani’s VIT is 6, her final ARM will be 110% of this value,
rounding down leaves her with an ARM of 8.
Magic Armor: The Leather Plate, Leather Gauntlets and Cap
have M. ARM ratings of 3, 1, and 3 respectively, for a total of 7. As Kumani’s SPR is 6, her final M. ARM will be 110% of this
value, rounding down; the end result is an M. ARM of 7.
Magic Evasion: Kumani’s Evasion is equal to her MAG of 9
plus her SPR of 6, or 15.
Accuracy: The Blue Mage’s Attack Bonus is +20; with a
Level of 1 and an AGI of 5, Kumani’s final ACC is 31 plus the
relevant Weapon skill.
Magic Accuracy: With a Level of 1 and a MAG of 9, Kumani’s
M. ACC is 119.
Mind: Mind is 69, or 50 plus Kumani's Level of 1 plus (MAG
x 2), which comes out to 18.
Dexterity: Dexterity is 61, or 50 plus Kumani's Level of 1
plus (AGI x 2), which comes out to 10.

### 08. Skills

The character's Skills are the next thing to consider. Depending on
their Job, characters will have a certain number of Skill Points to
allocate between Skills chosen from the lists in Chapter Five. In
general, Mage Jobs have the highest Skill Point totals, Warriors the
lowest. All Skills are purchased at a rate of 1 Skill Point per 1 point
of Skill Rating unless a character has an Aptitude towards the Skill
Category in question, as explained below. Some Skills may also be
double-cost, and require twice as many Skill Points to raise. All Skills
purchased during character creation must have a minimum Rating of
20, and cannot exceed a Rating of 50. All Jobs must have at least
one Weapon Skill at the minimum Rating of 20, and gain Awareness
at a Rating of 30 at no cost to their Skill Points.
Keep in mind that all of a character's Skills should be plausibly
consistent with their background – it’d be hard to believe that a
blacksmith’s son wouldn’t have had the time to pick up at least a few
points in Crafting* or Repair. On the flipside, a foundling adopted
and raised by roaming monsters would hardly have the opportunity
or capacity to have learned Etiquette.

#### SKILL APTITUDES

A character's chosen Job will have its repercussions on their ability
to learn certain types of Skills – it goes without saying, for instance,
that a Fighter is able to pick up new weapons more easily than a
Black Mage. In game terms, this is expressed through Skill
Aptitudes. A Job's Skill Aptitude represents a group of Skills a
character’s training is likely to put a heavier focus on. Skill Points put
into a Skill belonging to a Category the character has an Aptitude to
are spent at a rate of 1:2; that is to say, for every one Point spent,
the Skill's Rating increases by 2.

> **Generating a Character (12)**  
As a Blue Mage, Kumani has a Skill Aptitude for Wilderness
Skills and 260 Skill Points to spend. Carl decides Kumani’s
Skills should reflect her martial arts training as well as a
generally more rough-and-tumble character capable of
surviving in the wilds. For the former, he puts 15 Points apiece
into Scavenge, Survival, and Swimming. As all three are
Wilderness Skills, this raises each Skill’s Rating to 30, leaving
Carl with another 215 Points to spend. To represent Kumani’s
training and aptitudes as a brawler, he next takes Brawl at the
maximum possible Rating at 50, plus Acrobatics at 40,
Cooking at 30, and Intimidation at 40. This leaves 55 Points;
to round off the selection, Carl takes two Skills to represent
Kumani’s involvement with less savory elements: Escape at 25
and Streetwise at 30.

#### LORES AND LANGUAGES
In addition to the Skill Points allocated by the character’s Job, the
character receives an additional 160 Points solely for purchasing the
Scholastic Skills Lore* and Language*. This represents the
character’s ‘knowledge base.' The character also gains Common
Tongue at a Rating of 50, regardless of any other Lore* and
Language* Skills purchased; this does not decrease the available
quantity of Skill Points.

> **Generating a Character (13)**  
Now Carl selects Kumani’s Lore* and Language* Skills. 50
Points are spent on obtaining a Skill Rating of 50 in Bahsa
Mithra – enough to give Kumani a comfortable level of
proficiency to complement her Common Tongue. This leaves
Carl with a further 110 Points. 30, 50 and 30 Points are spent
on the Lore*s Blue Magic, Martial Arts and World Lore
respectively, rounding off Kumani’s Skill selection in the
process.

#### DEFERRING SKILL SELECTION

Under normal circumstances, any Skill Points not spent during
character creation do not carry over into the game proper, and are
lost if left unspent by the time the character is finished. However, if
the players find themselves struggling to come up with a Skill set
that suits their characters, the GM may wish to allow them to start
FINAL FANTASY – THE ROLEPLAYING GAME 32
the game with a minimal selection and choose the rest of their Skills
during the course of the game.  
Make a note of how many Points the character had for
conventional Skills, Lore*, and Language* when the game started.
At any point during the game, the player can declare that they have
background in a given Skill, and spend some of their ‘stock’ of
Points to obtain the Skill at a Rating of 20 or higher. Ideally, this
should be done in a fashion that reveals a little more about the
character – a quick aside like “Didn’t you know I was an expert
fisherman when I was younger?” These points can also be spent on
Skills gained through revelation, as described further on.  
Note that Points gained by deferring Skill selection cannot be
spent on raising Skills upon gaining a Level – they are exclusively to
be used on acquiring new Skills.

### 09. Magic

_You can ignore this section if your character doesn't have access to magic._

Not every Job can cast Spells, and not all spellcasting Jobs actually
start the game with the ability to use magic. Characters with a Job
that has the ability to cast Black, White, Red, or Time Magic begin
with three Level 1 Spells chosen from the appropriate Spell lists in
Chapter 8.  
Due to the non-linear progression of Blue, Spellblade, Summon,
and Call Magic, characters with access to these schools of
spellcasting generate their starting Spells in a slightly different
fashion. Rather than choose a set number of Spells, Blue Mages may
choose any number of appropriate Spells from the lists given in
Chapter 8, provided that their combined MP Costs do not exceed the
character's starting MP value. It is additionally recommended that
no one Spell in the starting selection cost more than 15 MP.  
Magic Knights begin with one Element Strike spell and one Status
Effect spell chosen from the level 1 Spell effects.  
Summoners begin the game with one Summon – either Valefor,
Lakshmi, Remora, Ifrit, Ramuh, or Shiva, as per the player’s choice.
Callers may choose from only Valefor, Lakshmi, or Remora, and
additionally gain two Level 1 Spells chosen from the appropriate
Spell lists.

> **Generating a Character (14)**  
As a Blue Mage, Kumani can select up to 21 MPs' worth of
Spells from the Blue Magic list. Carl chooses Goblin Punch (1
MP), Choco Ball (6 MP), Red Feast (6 MP), and Leap (8 MP)
for a round 21.

### 10. Inventions

_You can ignore this section if you did not create and engineer._

Characters with the Engineer Job finish character creation by
assembling a single Invention using the rules in Appendix I. The
player can use up to 100 Gil worth of Parts without dipping into their
own pockets; if the final Invention costs more than 100 Gil, the
difference is paid from the character's starting Gil. Parts used in the
starting Invention are subject to the same Availability restrictions as
any other equipment purchased during character creation

### 11. Traits

If the GM is using the optional rules for Key Points and Traits, Traits
should be selected relatively early in the character creation process.
Full rules for doing so can be found in Appendix IV.

### 12. Finishing Touches

To speed up gameplay later on, players may want to go through
their listed Damage Codes and precalculate Spell, Ability and Attack
damages, making a note of the results on their character sheets.
> **Generating a Character (15)**  
Kumani begins the game with three damage equations – that
of her basic Attack Actions with Leather Gloves, that of
Chocoball, and that of Leap. The Leather Gloves have a
Damage Code of (2 x STR) + d6; with an STR of 6, the final
Damage Code is 12 + d6. Choco Ball and Leap both have
Damage Codes of (4 x MAG) + d8, M. Armor; plugging in
Kumani’s MAG of 9 results in a precalculated Damage Code of
36 + d8, M. Armor. Goblin Punch and Red Feast do not need
separate calculations – they are a function of Kumani’s basic
Attack Action damage.
