## Character Advancement

As characters triumph against overwhelming odds and defeat
implacable foes, they start accumulating Experience Points. XP are
awarded as the GM sees fit, but are typically earned by killing or
incapacitating opponents, solving puzzles, disarming traps, and
completing quests.  
Once a character accumulates enough XP, they advance a Level,
increasing in power. Gaining a Level requires (Current Level x 500)
Experience Points; Kumani, the Level 1 character introduced in this
chapter, needs (1 x 500) -- or 500 – XP to get from Level 1 to
Level 2. Note that XP totals are not cumulative; earning 1000 XP to
advance to Level 2 does not mean you need only 500 XP to reach
Level 3. The following table gives a detailed breakdown of XP
requirements for each Level.

|Level      |XP Required|Total XP   |Level      |XP Required|Total XP   |Level      |XP Required|Total XP   |

### Learning New Abilities

Most Jobs gain new Abilities at certain Levels – on average, every 7
Levels up to Level 64. The Level an Ability is gained is shown in
Chapter 4 to the right of the Ability's name. For instance, the
Samurai gains the Ability Mineuchi at Level 8; the Fighter the Ability
Third Eye.

### Learning New Spells

Characters with access to White, Black, Time, or Red Magic will gain
new Spells every few Levels, allowing them to pick a Spell from a
given Spell Level and add it to their repertoire. The exact Levels this
occurs at will be given in the Job's profile in Chapter 4. Note that in
order to be able to select a Spell, any prerequisites the Spell has
must be met – to choose Fira, for instance, a character must also
have learned Fire. Prerequisites are laid out in Chapter 8.

#### BLUE AND SUMMON MAGIC

New Blue and Summon Spells can only be acquired during the
course of a session, and are gained independently of the
character's current Level. To obtain a new Blue Spell, a character
must either be targeted by it or successfully observe its use with the
Support Ability Azure Lore. To obtain a new Call or Summon, the
character must either defeat the Summon in battle or complete a
task to earn the Summon's trust. In certain cases, Blue Spells, Calls,
and Summons may be awarded through items found during the
session or given out as quest rewards.
### Increasing Hit and Magic Points

Every time a character gains a Level, their maximum Hit Points
increase by Job's Hit Die + (VIT / 2). Jobs with a Magic Die also
increase their maximum Magic Points by Job's Magic Die + (SPR /
2). All rolls should be made in front of the rest of the group or GM,
and calculated before any other changes are made to the character.

### Increasing Attributes

Characters receive 1 Attribute Point every time they gain a Level.
This may be allocated to any of the character’s six Attributes,
provided that Attribute Points are not spent on the same Attribute
two Levels in a row and that the increase does not raise the
Attribute above the character’s Attribute Cap. The Attribute Cap is
determined by adding the character’s Job bonus for that Attribute to
their Racial Maximum. A Human Fighter, for instance, would have an
Attribute Cap of 25 in STR – his Racial Maximum of 10 plus the
Fighter’s +15 bonus to STR. Attributes may be raised after the
character has reached the Attribute Cap, but this requires 2 Attribute
Points rather than 1 and may only be done once all Attributes are at
their respective Caps.  
The only other circumstance under which an Attribute Cap can be
'broken' is with Equipment Abilities. Note that the absolute maximum
value permitted for an Attribute is 30, including bonuses from
equipment – a character with STR 28 equipping a Hyper Wrist (+5
STR) would only raise her Strength to 30, not 33.  
Once an Attribute has been raised, adjust the character’s Attribute
Ratings and Combat Statistics accordingly. If the player has been
keeping track of it, precalculated damage may also need to be
adjusted as a result of this.

### Increasing Skills

Upon gaining a Level, a character receives 10 Skill Points to spend
on improving Skill Ratings and 6 points for improving Language* and
Lore* ratings; unused Skill Points are not carried over to the next
Level, and a lost unless spent. Ratings are raised at the same rates
as during character creation – 1 to 1 for most Skills, 1 to 2 for Skills
the character has an Affinity to, and 2 to 1 for Skills explicitly listed
as costing twice the normal rate. The player may distribute their Skill
Points as they choose, but once a Skill's Rating has reached 50, it
cannot be increased by more than 2 after a Level has been gained.
In addition, no Skill’s Rating may ever be raised above 100.

### Learning Skills

New Skills may also be learned upon gaining a Level using one of
three methods: revelation, teaching, or research. Each of these
three methods has its own requirements.

#### REVELATION

Sometimes, characters find they have talents and depths they didn't
even know they possessed. A character that rolls a Critical Success
on a defaulted Skill Roll may immediately gain that Skill at a Rating of
20 or the characters default, whichever is highest. However, not any
Skill Roll will do – paddling across a shallow pond isn't enough to
learn Swimming, no matter how quickly you reach the other side. For
revelations to strike, the Task Check's CoS must be 40 or lower. As
successful rolls made under the Rule of 10 do not count as a Critical
Success, they cannot be used to gain Skills through revelation. Any
number of Skills may be learned at once in this manner.

#### TEACHING

Alternately, characters may opt to learn a Skill from another
character – PC or NPC – with the Teaching Skill. If nobody in the
party has this Skill, the character must track down an appropriate
teacher using either their own network of contacts or the Inquiry
Skill. Teachers who aren't personal friends or allies of the character
may demand a fee for training; suggested costs have been given
below.
Table 2-3: Teaching Costs

|SKILL'S DEFAULT RATING|COST PER SKILL|
|:-------------------:|:-------------:|
|1 – 20| 200 G|
|21 – 30| 500 G|
|31 – 40 |2000 G|
|41 – 50 |5000 G|
| Learned Skill | 300 G |

Once all costs have been paid, the PC – or NPC – with the Teaching
Skill must make a Task Check against it to see if instruction is
successful. To determine the Conditional Modifier for this Task Check,
add together all applicable modifiers from the list below.

CONDITIONAL MODIFIERS  
Teacher's Skill Rating in Skill being taught less than 50: **-20**  
Teaching Intuitive Skill: **+20**  
Teaching Learned Skill: **0**  
Ample time (10 or more days): **+20**  
Sufficient time (5 days): **0**  
Inadequate time (2 to 3 days): **-20**  
Extreme time pressure (1 day or less): **-60**  

If the Task Check is successful, the character gains the Skill at a
Rating of 20 or the characters default, whichever is highest.
Otherwise, the time and money invested have been wasted; the
character can start again, but may need to spend additional Gil to
continue learning. A Critical Failure typically means that an accident
occurred during the learning process, with results left to the GM's
discretion. This may leave an NPC teacher unwilling to deal with the
character again, forcing the character to find a new instructor. In the
event of a Critical Success, the character has an unexpected
breakthrough, halving the time needed to learn the Skill. Only one
Skill at a time may be learned in this manner.

#### RESEARCH

Instead of learning a new Skill from another person, a character can
also attempt to pick it up from magazines, books, or computer
programs. If the character does not have access to the materials
they need to do their research, they must buy or obtain them
beforehand. Research materials have an Availability Rating of 90 by
default, though this may be lowered for unusual or specialized Skills;
suggested costs have been given below.

|CHARACTER'S LEVEL | COST PER SKILL|
|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|1 – 20 |300 G|
|21 – 30| 750 G|
|31 – 40| 3000 G|
|41 – 50| 7500 G|
|Learned Skill|500 G|

Once the materials have been obtained, the character must make a
Task Check against Inquiry. To determine the Conditional Modifier for
this Task Check, add together all applicable modifiers from the list
below.

CONDITIONAL MODIFIERS  
Researching Intuitive Skill: **+20**  
Researching Learned Skill: **0**  
Ample time (10 or more days): **+20**  
Sufficient time (5 days): **0**  
Inadequate time (2 to 3 days): **-20**  
Extreme time pressure (1 day or less): **-60**  

If the Task Check is successful, the character gains the Skill at a
Rating of 20 or the characters default, whichever is highest.
Otherwise, the character's materials are insufficient; the character
can start again, but may need to spend additional Gil to acquire new
material. A Critical Failure typically means that an accident occurred
during the learning process, with results left to the GM's discretion.
In the event of a Critical Success, the character has an unexpected
breakthrough, halving the time needed to learn the Skill. Only one
Skill at a time may be learned in this manner.

## Experienced Characters

Though most of the FFRPG assumes that a character will begin a
game at Level 1 and work their way up the ranks, a GM may wish to
start characters off at a higher Level. There are two ways to do this.
The most ‘accurate’ involves creating a Level 1 character, then
manually leveling them up until they have reached the appropriate
Level, calculating HP and MP gains as appropriate. However, this
method requires a considerable amount of time and effort, making it
impractical for most players. For this reason, the following pages
present a ‘fast-track’ method for creating higher-Level characters
on the fly. For the most part, the player should continue to follow the
steps outlined in this chapter; the salient changes run as follows.

### Attributes
Experienced characters have 40 + (LVL-1) Attribute Points to divide
between the six Attributes, following the same one-to-one ratio as in
normal character creation. The absolute limit for any Attribute’s
value is equal to the Racial Maximum in that Attribute plus their
chosen Job’s bonus. For instance, a Human Monk would be able to
raise their STR to 25 – 10 for the Racial Maximum, plus 15 for the
Job bonus.

### Combat Statistics

Combat Statistics are generated as normal, with the exception of Hit
Points and Magic Points. These are generated using the following
formulas:

```
30 + VIT + (Level x Hit Die) + ((VIT / 2) x (Level - 1))
10 + SPR + (Level x Magic Die) + ((SPR / 2) x (Level - 1))
```

Both formulas use the median value of Job’s Hit and Magic Dice
rather than a roll. A Job with a d10 Hit Die, for instance, would have
a value of 5, while a Job with a d6 Hit Die would have a value of 3.
As at character creation, any Job without a Magic Die will have 0 MP,
regardless of their Spirit.

### Skills

An experienced character receives a number of Skill Points equal to
those received by a Level 1 character of their chosen Job, plus a
bonus of 10 x (Level - 1) Points. They also receive the standard
160 Points for Language* and Lore* Skills – with Common Tongue
at a Rating of 50 and Awareness at 30 for free – plus an additional
6 x (Level - 1) Points for Language* and Lore* skills. Skills still have
a minimum Rating of 20, but can have a maximum Rating of up to
48 + (2 x Level), with an absolute maximum of 100.

### Equipment

Experienced characters receive more Gil for buying equipment and
items; at higher Levels, they will also have access to equipment not
normally purchasable by starting characters. The table below gives
recommended benchmarks for Gil awards, as well as suggested
Availability limits for starting equipment.
Table 2-5: Starting Gil and Equipment

LEVEL GIL AVAILABILITY EQUIPMENT
1 500 91% ---
2 600 90% ---
3 800 89% ---
4 1100 88% ---
5 1500 87% ---
6 2000 86% ---
7 2750 85% ---
8 3500 84% ---
9 4250 83% ---
10 5000 82% ---
20 15000 70% ---
30 30000 57% ---
40 40000 45% ---
50 40000 32% 1 Artifact
65+ 40000 13% 2 Artifacts
1 Legendary

For characters with Levels between these benchmarks, use the table
below to determine exact values. Round down for purposes of
determining Availability Ratings.
Table 2-6: Level-Specific Adjustments

LEVEL GIL PER LEVEL AVAILABILITY PER LEVEL
11 – 20 +1000 -1.25%
21 – 30 +1500 -1.25%
31 – 40 +1000 -1.25%
41 – 50 --- -1.25%
51 – 65 --- -1.25%

Once all this has been done, all that remains is for the player to
choose their equipment. For instance, a character created at Level
14 would have 9000 Gil in spending money – 5000 for the Level 10
default, plus an additional 1000 for Levels 11 through 14 – and
would be able to buy equipment with an Availability Rating of 77% or
greater.
EXPERIENCED ENGINEERS
At Level 1, Engineers receive a 'stipend' of 100 Gil with which to put
together a starting Invention. Engineers starting at a higher Level
receive a larger stipend; its exact value is given on the table below.
Note that a Level 65+ Engineer also receives one free Artifact Part
of their choice to use in a starting Invention.
Table 2-7: Invention Stipends

LEVEL INVENTION STIPEND ARTIFACT PARTS
1 100 ---
2 120 ---
3 160 ---
4 220 ---
5 300 ---
6 400 ---
7 550 ---
8 700 ---
9 850 ---
10 1000 ---
20 3000 ---
30 6000 ---
40 8000 ---
50 10000 ---
65+ 10000 1

For characters with Levels between these benchmarks, use the table
below to determine exact values.
Table 2-8: Invention Stipend Details

LEVEL RANGE GIL PER LEVEL
11 – 20 200
21 – 30 300
31 – 40 300
41 – 50 200
51 – 65 ---

Magic
Characters capable of using Black, White, Red, or Time Magic gain
starting Spells as normal, plus any additional Spells their Level would
qualify them for, as listed in their Job profiles. As with starting
characters, characters with Blue, Call, or Summon Magic generate
their Spell lists in a slightly different fashion.
BLUE MAGIC
Generate starting Spells as per standard character creation. Once
the initial selection has been made, the character can take up to
(Level / 3) additional Spells chosen from the Blue Magic list. While
any combination of Spells can be picked in this fashion, no Spell’s
MP cost should exceed the limits given below.
Table 2-9: Blue Magic Limits
CHARACTER'S LEVEL MAXIMUM MP COST
1 – 16 18
17 – 24 27
25 – 32 40
33 – 40 50
41 – 48 119
49 – 56 139
57+ ---

CALL MAGIC
Generate starting Calls as per standard character creation. Once the
initial selection has been made, the character can take up to (Level /
8) additional Calls chosen from the Summon Magic list. While any
combination of Calls can be picked in this fashion, no Call’s MP cost
should exceed the limits given below.
Table 2-10: Call Magic Limits
CHARACTER'S LEVEL MAXIMUM MP COST
1 – 8 21
9 – 16 52
17 - 24 77
25 – 32 90
41 – 48 125
49 – 56 176
57+ ---
SUMMON MAGIC
Generate starting Summons as per standard character creation.
Once the initial selection has been made, the character can take up
to (Level / 12) additional Summons chosen according to the list
given below.
Table 2-11: Summon Magic Limits
