## Advantages

The following Advantages are available to FFRPG characters. Note
that some Advantages have a varying effect depending on how many
points they are bought for – these are listed below the general
effect.

### Adroit 2 to 5 Points
Effect: Not every character fights using force. Sometimes, where and
how the weapon hits is more important than the raw power behind
it. This Advantage may be taken multiple times.
2 Points: Select one Weapon category that uses a d6 Damage Die,
such as Rods. When wielding a Weapon of the chosen category, all
damage is calculated using AGI, rather than STR.
3 Points: Select one Weapon category that uses a d8 Damage Die,
such as Staves. When wielding a Weapon of the chosen category, all
damage is calculated using AGI, rather than STR.
4 Points: Select one Weapon category that uses a d10 Damage Die,
such as Swords. When wielding a Weapon of the chosen category, all
damage is calculated using AGI, rather than STR.
5 Points: Select one Weapon category that uses a d12 Damage Die,
such as Greatswords. When wielding a Weapon of the chosen
category, all damage is calculated using AGI, rather than STR.
Ambidextrous 1 Point
Effect: The character is equally skilled with both hands, favoring
neither left nor right. Characters with this Advantage do not suffer
penalties for Off-Handed attacks as described in Chapter 7. In
addition, they may purchase the Skill Two Weapons at the normal
rate of one Skill Point per one point of Skill Rating.
Animal Companion 1 to 5 Points
Effect: The character is accompanied in his journeys by a faithful
animal, such as a trained dog or a mount. The Animal Companion is
small – or agile – enough to avoid damage in combat; if the
character controlling the Animal Companion is reduced to 0 HP or
otherwise incapacitated, it will not act until its owner has been
revived.
The exact powers of an Animal Companion are determined by
selecting a combination of talents from the list below. Each Point
spent on this Advantage allows the player to select up to 10 points'
worth of talents from this list. This Advantage may be taken multiple
times to create more than one Companion.
Sentient (2): The Animal Companion has intelligence comparable to
a human's, and is capable of speaking and understanding Common
Tongue.
Summoned (2): The Animal Companion is of magical or supernatural
origins, and is summoned up with a simple ritual. In combat, this can
be accomplished through a Zero Action.
Packrat (3): The Animal Companion can carry a few of the
character's odds and ends, and acts as an emergency reserve. In
game terms, this means that the character will always have access
to their Inventory if the Companion is present. If the Carrying
Alternative rules from Chapter 6 are used, the Companion can carry
up to 5 Items.
Senses (3): The Animal Companion has senses good enough to
assist the party in times of need. In game terms, the companion is
treated as having Awareness at a Skill Rating of 50.
Attribute (5): The Animal Companion is strong, fast, or smart enough
to help the party out when needed. In game terms, this gives the
Companion an Attribute Rating of 50 in one Attribute of the creator's
choice, and allows it to make Task Checks against that Attribute if it
ever is in a position to do so.
Flying (5): The Animal Companion has wings strong enough to fly
with, giving it greater range and reach. In practical terms, this allows
the Companion to enter the Status Condition Flight at will. If
combined with the Mount attribute, the Companion is treated as a
flying mount for purposes of travel times – see Chapter 9 for more
details.
Keen Senses (5): The Animal Companion has a keen set of senses,
allowing it to sniff out danger, discover otherwise-hidden objects, or
track others over long distances. In game terms, the Companion is
treated as having the Awareness and Tracking Skills at a Skill Rating
of 60.
Large (5): The Companion is larger than normal. If used in
conjunction with Mount, up to two characters may ride it. Item
capacity for Mount and Packrat is increased to 60.
Mount (5): The Animal Companion can be ridden with a successful
Riding Skill Test, reducing travel times accordingly – see Chapter 9
for more details. If using the Carrying Alternative rule from Chapter
6, the Mount can carry an additional 30 Items.
Search (5): The Animal Companion is constantly sniffing around and
digging in the search for usable items. Once per session, a character
whose Animal Companion has the Search talent gains one free Item
– Battle, Support, or Recovery – of the GM’s choice, with a Tier
appropriate to the character's current Level. This does not reduce
any other item rewards the character obtains.
Skilled (5): The Animal Companion has a certain talent that comes in
handy for its owner – a monkey trained in Pickpocketing, for
instance, makes an ideal accomplice with a budding Thief. Split 50
Skill Points between any combination of Skills to represent the
companion’s talents; Skills must be bought at a minimum rating of
20 as normal. Technical Skills cannot be taken in conjunction with
Skilled.
Highly Skilled (10): As with Skilled, above. However, the Animal
Companion is clever enough to continue learning, and gains 1
additional Skill Point for every Level gained by its owner. It can learn
new Skills at 50% the Gil cost it would take a character to learn a
comparative Skill; in addition, a character with Animal Training may
attempt to teach it new Skills in the same manner as the Teaching
Skill. Technical Skills cannot be taken in conjunction with Highly
Skilled.
Outstanding Attribute (10): As Attribute, above. The Animal
Companion gains an Attribute Rating of 80 rather than 50.
Very Large (10): The Companion is unusually large. If used in
conjunction with Mount, up to six characters may ride it. Item
capacity for Mount and Packrat is increased to 99.
Counter Fang (20): Whenever the character is struck by a successful
Attack Action, the animal companion has a CoS of 30% of launching
an immediate counter-attack at the opponent who struck the
character. This is treated as an Attack Action using the character’s
own ACC; damage is ((Character’s Level / 4) x Character’s STR) +
(Level / 10)d6. Damage can be based on AGI or MAG instead; if so,
this must be declared when taking the Advantage and applied
consistently for the remainder of the character’s adventuring career.
If the Companion has Guardian as well, the two have a combined flat
CoS of 30%; roll once to determine if both effects trigger. Counter
Fang is considered a Reaction Ability, and thus can be disabled by
the Status Condition Immobilize.
Guardian (30): Whenever the character is struck by a successful
Attack Action, the Animal Companion has a flat CoS of 30% of
intercepting the blow. If successful, the character only takes 50%
damage from the attack before modifying for ARM or M. ARM. If the
Companion has Counter Fang as well, the two have a combined flat
CoS of 30%; roll once to determine if both effects trigger. Guardian
is considered a Reaction Ability, and thus can be disabled by the
Status Condition Immobilize.
Additional Options: Pending GM approval, the player can use the
Animal Companion Advantage to make other allies such as hirelings,
robots, or vehicles.
Combat Reflexes 2 Points
Effect: Through intensive training – or a healthy dose of paranoia –
the character is adept at being able to react to danger at a
moment’s notice. As a result, a character with Combat Reflexes can
never be surprised in battle, and will always act in the Preemptive
Round if ambushed. In addition, she is immune to the Status
Condition Unaware.
Full Moon Heart 4 Points
Effect: The character has a greater sensitivity to the flow of mana,
and is able to replenish her spellcasting energies far quicker than
most. Items and other effects that increase a character’s MP restore
+25% of their usual Magic Points when used on a character with
Full Moon Heart.
Restrictions: Full Moon Heart does not affect Drain effects or HP
recovery.
Gillionaire 2 to 5 Points
Effect: The character has a knack for finding money in unexpected
places or a secondary source of income. As a result, he gains Gil at
a faster rate than his companions. The character's share of Gil for
each monster encounter and successfully completed quest is
adjusted by the listed percentage to reflect their additional income.
This does not increase or reduce the payout to other characters or
NPCs, or affect other sources of income. The character’s starting Gil
is also accordingly increased to match.
2 Points: The character’s share of Gil is adjusted by +5%. The
character’s starting Gil is accordingly increased to 525 G.
3 Points: The character’s share of Gil is adjusted by +10%. The
character’s starting Gil is accordingly increased to 550 G.
4 Points: The character’s share of Gil is adjusted by +15%. The
character’s starting Gil is accordingly increased to 575 G.
5 Points: The character’s share of Gil is adjusted by +20%. The
character’s starting Gil is accordingly increased to 600 G.
Restrictions: Gillionaire does not stack with the Equipment Ability
Headhunter. During character creation, this Advantage does not
affect the value of Heirlooms, starting Inventions, or other “extras”
not tied directly to starting Gil.
Goddess's Mark 3 Points
Effect: The character is attuned to the ebb and tide of Life Magic,
and benefits significantly from healing effects. Items, Spells and other
effects that increase a character’s HP restore +25% of their usual
Hit Points when used on a character with Goddess’s Mark.
Restrictions: Goddess’s Mark does not affect Drain effects or MP
recovery.
Good Fortune 1 to 3 Points
Effect: Some force from beyond looks out for the character, tweaking
fate to act in their favor.
1 Point: Once per session, the character can re-roll any one die roll
once. Unused rolls do not carry over to the next session.
2 Points: Twice per session, the character can re-roll any one die roll
once. Unused rolls do not carry over to the next session.
3 Points: Three times per session, the character can re-roll any one
die roll once. Unused rolls do not carry over to the next session.
Hardened 1 to 2 Points
Effect: The character is tougher and heartier than her fellows, and
can absorb far more damage in the long term.
1 Point: The character gains an additional 1 Hit Point per Level.
2 Points: The character gains an additional 2 Hit Points per Level.

Effect: A precious artifact has been passed down in the character's
family for generations; now the character is able to use this heirloom
for her own benefit. The character may take one Accessory worth up
to 2500 G at character creation in addition to any other equipment
purchased.
Restrictions: Heirlooms may not be sold or otherwise disposed of
under any circumstances, and must remain equipped until the
character reaches Level 11.

to the eradication of a particular type of monster, and is far more
adept against it in battle. This Advantage may be taken multiple
times.
1 Point: The character has trained against a specific Monster Family
(Zuu, Goblin, Flan), and inflicts +100% damage with every Attack
Action made against monsters of this type. Declare which Family
Monster Killer is tied to when purchasing this Advantage.
3 Points: The character has trained against a specific Monster
Category, and inflicts +100% damage with every Attack Action made
against monsters of this type. Declare which Monster Category
Monster Killer is tied to when purchasing this Advantage.
Restrictions: Abnormal cannot be taken as a Monster Category.
Multitalented 1 to 2 Points
Effect: The character has a knack for quickly picking up additional
knowledge. This Advantage may be taken multiple times.

him an Affinity to, Weapon Skills excluded. The character gains an
additional Affinity for that Skill Category.
2 Points: The character gains an Affinity to Weapon Skills.
Personal Element 2 to 5 Points
Effects: The character has a deep, personal connection and
familiarity with one of the world's elements, and is capable of
wielding it with fierce power. This Advantage may be taken multiple

associated with the chosen Element.

Conditions. All Conditions of this type that target the character have
their CoS halved after modifying for Evasion or M. Evasion.

of effectively wielding equipment not typically used by his job. This
Advantage may be taken multiple times.
1 Points: The character gains access to one additional Weapon type
his Job would normally not have access to, provided it can use STR
to calculate damage and does not have a Damage Die higher than
that of those the Weapon types the Job can freely access. If a
weapon has the Double Strike, Mana Channel, or Quicksilver ability,
then it will cost an additional point. Alternately, the character gains

Should the character end a battle at 0 HP or below, she will revive
with 1 HP once the battle is over.
Restrictions: Tenacious has no effect on a battle in progress. Should
the character be felled during a fight, only a Phoenix Down, Raise
Spell, or similar effect will restore her. Furthermore, Tenacious has
no effect on other incapacitating effects such as Stone.

## Disadvantages

The following Disadvantages are available to FFRPG characters. Like
Advantages, some Disadvantages have a varying effect depending
on how many points they are bought for.

### Blind 1, 4, or 5 Points
Effect: The character is no longer able to see, usually as a result of
an accident or combat injury. As a result, the character is considered
to permanently be under the effects of the Status Condition Blind.
1 Point: A character with a Mage Job gains Blind.
4 Points: A character with an Adept Job gains Blind.
5 Points: A character with an Expert or Warrior Job gains Blind.
Code of Honor 2 Points
Effect: A sense of honor has its downsides at times. Because she
has sworn to never attack a helpless opponent, the character will
never take advantage of the element of surprise. A character with
Code of Honor will not attack opponents suffering from the Status
Conditions Unaware, Sleep, or Stop, and never acts in the
Preemptive Round if her opponents cannot act in turn.
Code of Mercy 1 to 2 Points
The character has sworn never to take a life. Whenever a character
with Code of Mercy takes an Action that would reduce a target to 0
HP, they will ‘pull the blow’ to leave the target with 1 Hit Point. Under
no circumstances can the character kill anything while they remain
under their own control; the only exception to this rule are attacks
made under the influence of Mystify-type Status Conditions.
1 Point: A character with an Adept, Mage, or Expert Job gains Code
of Mercy.
2 Points: A character with a Warrior Job gains Code of Mercy.
Coward 4 Points
Effect: Some people can't take the heat. The character fears death
more than anything, and will go to great lengths to escape it. If the
character is ever reduced to 25% or fewer of their maximum Hit
Points in combat, their next available Action will always be an Escape
Action. If the Escape Action fails, the character will try to Escape
again on every following action he has until he either successfully
retreats from battle or is healed to above 25% HP.
Restrictions: Coward cannot be taken in conjunction with Fury.
Crippled Arm 3 to 4 Points
Effect: One of the character’s arms is missing or lame, making it
useless in battle. The character loses their Shield slot; they may only
equip one Weapon, cannot benefit from the Two Weapons Skill, or
wield Weapons which occupy both Shield and Weapon slots.
3 Points: A character with an Expert or Mage Job gains Crippled
Arm.
4 Points: A character with a Warrior or Adept Job gains Crippled Arm.
Defenseless 1 to 2 Points
Effect: The character lacks the focus or reflexes needed to dodge,
parry, or resist incoming attacks.
1 Point: The character’s natural Evasion or M. Evasion is 0. These
Combat Statistics can only be increased by bonuses from Equipment
or Status Conditions. Decide which of the two is affected when taking
this Disadvantage.
2 Points: The character’s natural Evasion and M. Evasion are both
0. These Combat Statistics can only be increased by bonuses from
Equipment or Status Conditions.
Devil's Brand 4 Points
Effect: The character's spark of life glows a little dimmer than most.
Items, Spells and other effects that increase a character’s HP
restore -25% of their normal Hit Points when used on a character
with Devil’s Brand.
Restrictions: Devil’s Brand does not affect Drain effects or MP
recovery.
Elemental Deficiency 3 Points
Effect: Something within the character leaves him vulnerable to a
particular Element. Select one of the Combat Element – Fire, Ice,
Lightning, Water, Wind, Earth, Holy, Shadow, or Bio. Any damage of
that element done to the character is increased by 50%. If the
character gains a Resistance to the Element in question, attacks do
normal damage; Immunities reduce damage to 50%, and
Absorbance reduces damage of that Element to 0. This
Disadvantage may be taken multiple times.
Favored Prey 2 Points
Effect: The character is particularly vulnerable to attack from certain
types of monsters. Declare a Monster Category Favored Prey is tied
to when selecting this Disadvantage; monsters of this type will inflict
+100% damage with every Attack Action they make against that
character. This Disadvantage may be taken multiple times.
Restrictions: Abnormal cannot be taken as a Monster Category.
Flat-Footed 2 Points
Effect: The character does not react to circumstances as quickly as
his fellow adventurers. As a result, he begins every battle with the
Status Condition Unaware active.
Frail 1 to 2 Points
Effect: The character is physically weaker than his fellows,
toughening up at a far slower pace.
1 Point: The character gains 1 Hit Point fewer per Level. This will
never reduce HP gains for advancing a Level below 1.
2 Points: The character gains 2 Hit Points fewer per Level. This will
never reduce HP gains for advancing a Level below 1.
Fury 1 to 3 Points
Effect: Deep inside the character is a raving, rabid beast that's just
waiting to get out. A character with Fury is automatically afflicted with
the Status Condition Berserk whenever her current Hit Points reach
25% or less of their maximum value during the course of battle.
This Condition persists for as long as the character remains at 25%
or less of her maximum Hit Points, and cannot be prevented or
canceled by any means.
1 Point: A character with a Warrior Job gains Fury.
2 Points: A character with an Adept Job gains Fury.
3 Points: A character with an Expert or Mage Job gains Fury.
Restrictions: Fury cannot be taken in conjunction with Coward.
Gold Sink 1 to 5 Points
Effect: The character has a hard time hanging on to money. Debts,
gambling, family obligations, charitable causes, or outright waste
quickly eat up whatever spare income he may have as a result of his
adventures. The character’s share of Gil for each monster encounter
and successfully completed quest is adjusted by the percentage
listed below to reflect wastage and lost money. This does not
increase or reduce the payout to other characters or NPCs. The
character’s starting Gil is accordingly reduced to match.
Modifiers for Gold Sink are always applied after any Gil acquisition
bonuses the character may be eligible for through Equipment
Abilities like Headhunter .
1 Point: The character’s share of Gil is adjusted by -5%. The
character’s starting Gil is accordingly reduced to 475 G.
2 Points: The character’s share of Gil is adjusted by -10%. The
character’s starting Gil is accordingly reduced to 450 G.
3 Points: The character’s share of Gil is adjusted by -15%. The
character’s starting Gil is accordingly reduced to 425 G.
4 Points: The character’s share of Gil is adjusted by -20%. The
character’s starting Gil is accordingly reduced to 400 G.
5 Points: The character’s share of Gil is adjusted by -25%. The
character’s starting Gil is accordingly reduced to 375 G.
Restrictions: During character creation, this Disadvantage does not
affect the value of Heirlooms, starting Inventions, or other “extras”
not tied directly to starting Gil.
Lamed 1 to 2 Points
Effect: The character is hobbled, and cannot move quickly or run. As
a result, he is considered to be permanently under the effects of the
Status Condition Immobilize.
1 Point: A character with a Mage Job – or Job whose Ability Set
contains no Reaction Abilities – gains Lamed.
2 Points: A character with an Adept, Expert or Warrior Job with
Reaction Abilities in its Ability Set gains Lamed.
Mute 1 to 2 Points
Effect: The character cannot speak. Though typically the result of
injury or physical disability, there are many other possible reasons
for this, ranging from a personal vow of silence to trauma. Under
normal circumstances, it is assumed that they have some alternate
means of communicating – sign language, facial expression,
strategically-deployed flash cards – which allows them to talk to
party members. For all intents and purposes, the character is
considered to permanently be under the effects of the Status
Condition Silence.
1 Point: A character with a Warrior or Expert Job gains Mute.
2 Points: A character with the Gambler Job gains Mute.
Restrictions: Bards, Mediators, and characters with Mage or Adept
Jobs may not take this Disadvantage.
Sealed Chi 1 to 2 Points
Effect: The character’s chi flow is blocked, leaving her incapable of
channeling it into her powers. As a result, she is considered to be
permanently under the effects of the Status Condition Curse.
1 Point: A character with a Mediator or Mage Job gains Sealed Chi.
2 Points: A character with a Bard, Dark Knight, Magic Knight, or
Paladin Job gains Sealed Chi.
Restrictions: Characters with Warrior Jobs or Expert and Adept Jobs
not listed above may not take this Disadvantage.
Slow Learner 2 to 6 Points
Effect: The character’s training is far from complete, and his powers
show it. As a result, the character gains their Abilities several Levels
behind what is normal for his job.
2 Point: The character gains the first Ability in his Ability Set 2 Levels
later than normal; every subsequent Ability is also gained 2 Levels
later.
3 Points: The character gains the first Ability in his Ability Set 4
Levels later than normal; every subsequent Ability is also gained 4
Levels later.
4 Points: The character gains the first Ability in his Ability Set 7
Levels later than normal; every subsequent Ability is also gained 7
Levels later.
5 Points: The character gains the first Ability in his Ability Set 11
Levels later than normal; every subsequent Ability is also gained 11
Levels later.
6 Points: The character gains the first Ability in his Ability Set 16
Levels later than normal; every subsequent Ability is also gained 16
Levels later.
Sluggish 2 or 5 Points
Effect: Slow to act and slow to react, the character is a constant
laggard in battle. As a result, he is considered to be permanently
under the effects of the Status Condition Slow.
2 Point: A character with a Mage or Adept Job gains Sluggish.
5 Points: A character with an Expert or Warrior Job gains Sluggish.
Soft Target 4 Points
Effect: The character is less resilient to damage than most. To
represent this, her ARM and M. ARM ratings are reduced by -50%
after factoring in all other bonuses from Equipment and Status
Conditions.
Unskilled 1 Point
Effect: The character is not nearly as adept at learning the Skills of
his profession as others. As a result, he loses one Skill Affinity
conferred by his Job.
Vulnerability 2 or 4 Points
Effect: The character is inherently vulnerable to certain Status
Conditions. If a Status of a type or category a character has a
Vulnerability to targets him, its CoS is doubled after modifying for
Evasion or M. Evasion; All [Status] Touch effects of the appropriate
type have a 60% CoS and [Status] Strike effects have a 90% CoS .
This Disadvantage may be taken multiple times, and is not affected
by Status Resistances and Immunities.
2 Points: The character may choose one of the following categories
of Status Condition to have a vulnerability to: Toxin or Weak.
3 Points: The character may choose one of the following categories
of Status Condition to have a vulnerability to: Seal or Transform.
4 Points: The character may choose one of the following categories
of Status Condition to have a vulnerability to: Mystify or Time.
Weapon Inability 2 to 3 Points
Effect: The character simply is out-and-out bad with weapons.
Weapon Skills are bought at twice the normal cost, and any Skill
Affinity the character may have for Weapon Skills is lost. In addition,
the character may never cause a Critical Hit with an Attack Action,
even if Equipment Abilities or other effects would normally increase
the chances of a Critical Hit.
2 Points: A character using a non-Weapon Skill for their primary
Weapon gains Weapon Inability.
3 Points: A character using a Weapon Skill for their primary Weapon
gains Weapon Inability.
