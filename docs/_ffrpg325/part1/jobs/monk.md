title: "Monk"
---

Monks are masters of unarmed combat, fighting with skills formed
by years of hard exercise and rigorous training. Unlike other
warriors, Monks are as deadly empty-handed as armed, wreaking
havoc on their opponents with feet, fists and any other part of their
body they can throw into an attack. However, these talents require
the Monk to remain unencumbered, making heavy armor more of a
hindrance than a benefit. An experienced Monk thus learns to rely on
their own fortitude more than any piece of protective gear.  
There are other tradeoffs as well – the Monk’s hermetic lifestyle,
with its emphasis on simple living and a regimen of demanding,
repetitive exercises, takes its toll on the young and impatient. Only
one in ten trainees ever ascends to true masterhood with it; the
majority break off their education with only a handful of kata under
their belts, culling the numbers of would-be Monks more effectively
than any foe.

### MARTIAL ARTS
As a master of unarmed combat, the Monk’s body is as dangerous a
weapon as any sword or spell. A Monk's martial arts thus combine
crippling bare-handed blows, spectacular energy attacks, and
spiritual discipline to devastating effect. Abilities in the Martial Arts
Set can only be used in conjunction with Weapons that use a d6 or
d8 Damage Die.

#### Stance Novice
**Level:** 1  
**Target:** Self  
**Type:** Support  

Choose from Fist of Fire, Fist of Wind, or Fist of Earth
Changing stance takes an action, you can choose a stance at the beginning of combat.

**Fist of Fire:** Deal additional damage when attacking or using Martial Arts equal to your level, take additional damage equal to half your level after armor & m.armor are applied. Actions that miss do not still deal damage, nor do actions that do not deal damage normal have damage added to them.  
**Fist of Earth:** Reduce incoming damage after armor & m. armor are applied by half your level, Your Move is reduced by 5; this cannot reduce your Move to less than 0. Abilities that force movement have the effect reduced by 3.  
**Fist of Wind:** Gain an additional move action on your turn. You may treat your speed as double outside of combat.

#### Brawler
**Level:** 5  
**Target:** Self  
**Type:** Support  

In any other profession's training, hand-to-hand fighting is a matter
of last resort. Monks, however, are taught to rely on their fists from
day one, honing their proficiency to the point where even a simple
punch can become a force to be reckoned with.  
Brawler allows a Monk to make two attacks against a target with
Claws, Flails, Gloves, Staves, or Brawling attacks at the cost of a
single Attack Action. Calculate damage as if the Monk had made two
separate Attack Actions against the target, rolling to hit as normal.
Brawler's effects do not stack with those of the Two Weapons Skill.

#### Shoulder Tackle

**Target:** Single  
**Type:** Fast Action  

Move to an enemy within Range equal to your Move. Deal 50% Physical Weapon Damage. Grants a different effect based on stance held.

**Fist of Earth:** Ignore the Move penalty of Fist of Earth. Unaware (2) CoS: 30%  
**Fist of Wind:** You may strike two different enemies with Shoulder Tackle. The second target must be in range of where you Move with the first target.
