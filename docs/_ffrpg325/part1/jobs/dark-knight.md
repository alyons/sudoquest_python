title: "Dark Knight"
---

Clad in all-concealing armor and striding with cool self-assurance,
Dark Knights are an imposing, even sinister presence on the
battlefield. Where other professions draw on chi or mana to fuel their
abilities, these shadowy warriors use raw life force â€“ by default their
own, though as their experience grows, they swiftly gain the ability to
leech the vitality of others to replenish their own.
Though Dark Knights are not inherently evil, the almost vampiric
nature of their abilities have made them the subject of intense fear
and distrust for countless years. More rumors surround this Job
than almost any other; some gossips claim their powers stem from a
pact with a devil, others that they age each time they use their
abilities, eventually dying a wizened husk once the last drop of life is
spent.  
Understandably, most Dark Knights are happy enough to
encourage these tales, even play them up by donning baroque,
spike-encrusted outfits designed to strike fear into the hearts of
weaker-willed opponents. Such armor is typically forged from
darksteel, an alloy of iron infused with Shadow energy during its
creation in order to protect the wearer from the effects of his own
attacks. Indeed, darksteel is so fundamental to Dark Knights' arms
and armor that the material has become almost synonymous with
the Job; other professions generally shy away from darksteel
equipment, lest they fall victim to the same stigma that has bedeviled
this poorly-understood profession for centuries.
