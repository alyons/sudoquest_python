title: "Black Mage"
---

Other schools of magic are capable of unleashing powerful attack
spells, crippling or incapacitating opponents with the wave of a hand.
Black Magic, however, makes it the raison d’etre, existing for
destruction and nothing else. Trained in the devastating power of
the elements, its practitioners are a fearsome presence on any
battlefield. Alone, they can blast any opponent within an inch of its
life; together, they can stop armies in their tracks.
