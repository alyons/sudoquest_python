title: "White Caller"
---

Like the Black Caller, the White Caller sports only limited mastery
over Summon Magic, compensating for this weakness through more
conventional forms of spellcasting. Where the Black Caller augments
her destructive power with Black Magic, the White Caller focuses on
healing and protection, using the power of her Summons to further
protect those in need.

magic.

[White Magic Spell List](/ffrpg3.5/ffrpg325/part3/magic/white/)

#### Intuitive Magic
**Level:** 1  
**Target:** Varies  
**Type:** Magic Ability  
Like a pure White Mage, the White Caller can use her spellcasting
abilities for other purposes. More details on Intuitive Magic can be
found in Chapter 8.  
**Keywords:** Healing, Holy, Wind, Barrier

### EVOCATION MAGIC
Like the Summoner, the White Caller is able to summon powerful
creatures from other worlds to serve and assist her, if only for short
periods of time. Though the process of finding and recruiting such
creatures is an arduous one, their power more than compensates for
any hardship.

#### Arcane Tongue
**Level:** 1  
**Target:** Varies  
**Type:** Support Ability  
White Callers have the ability to communicate with Summoned
Monsters and other creatures of magical origin as if they had a
relevant Language* Skill at a Rating of 100, even if the creature is
not normally capable of communicating with intelligent beings.

#### Call
**Level:** 1  
**Target:** Varies  
**Type:** Magic Ability (6)  
White Callers have the ability to call on Summoned Monsters from
the lists in Appendix III. In this case, the Summon in question
materializes long enough to unleash a single effect, then disappears.
White Callers gain one Summoned Monster – Lakshmi, Remora, or
Valefor – at Level 1, acquiring additional Summons as the game
progresses at the GM’s discretion.

#### Boost
**Level:** 30  
**Target:** Varies  
**Type:** Magic Ability (8)  
An experienced White Caller can increase the power of her Summon’s
attacks by spending additional time channeling a portion of her own
power and mana into them. Boost is used in the same manner as
Call, but increases the effect of the Summon – damage or healing –
by +25%. Aside from the increased Charge Time, the MP cost – or
Gil cost – of the Summon increases by +25% to compensate.
