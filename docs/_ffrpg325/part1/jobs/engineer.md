title: "Engineer"
---

Drills, robots, airships – the Engineer's mechanical wizardry
conjures any number of miracles from bolts, oil, and a little ingenuity.
Though their talents extend to all machines great and small,
Engineers channel most of their energy into bewildering inventions
they seem to spend every spare moment refining, building, and
designing. Unpredictable at best, these devices are just as likely to
spit out smoke as searing death, but every failure only seems to
redouble the Engineer’s determination – and any success more than
makes up for the embarrassing malfunctions along the way.

**HP Die:** d8  
**MP Die:** n/a  
**Weapons:** Crossbows, Claws, Gloves, Light Swords, Swords,
Polearms, Rifles  
**Armor:** Gauntlets, Hats, Suits, Shields  
**Accuracy Bonus:** +20  
**Skill Points:** 260  
**Skill Aptitudes:** Technical  
**Expertise Formula:** (Invent Rating / 2) + Level + (AGI x 2)  

### TOOLS
Engineers are firm believers in the power of a good set of tools –
with the right implement, anything can happen. Unlike other Experts,
rolls against the Engineer's Expertise can botch - any roll of 95 to
100 is considered an automatic miss or failure, regardless of the
character's Skill or other modifiers.

#### Invention
**Level:** 1  
**Target:** Self  
**Type:** Support Ability  
The Engineer is capable of creating and wielding Inventions using
the rules given in Appendix I. As described in Chapter 2, they begin
the game with a single device built during the character creation
process, and can assemble additional ones as the game progresses.
Initially, Engineers are limited to a single Invention Level 1 device,
but quickly learn to build bigger and better Inventions as they gain
experience. Every few Levels, they gain the ability to build another,
higher-level Invention. The exact progression for this is given in the
table below.

|INVENTION LEVEL|ACCESSIBLE AT LEVEL|
|-|-|
|1| 1|
|2| 8|
|3| 15|
|4| 22|
|5| 29|
|6| 36|
|7| 43|
|8| 50|
|9| 57|
|10| 64|

Regardless of how many Invention Levels the Engineer can access,
they are restricted to having one Invention of each Level at one
time. At Level 15, for instance, the Engineer could have one
Invention Level 1 device, one Invention Level 2 device, and one
Invention Level 3 device. If he wanted to build another Level 2
device, he would have to discard or dismantle the existing one. Using
an Invention in battle is a Fast Action by default, though the Delay
Defect turns this into a Slow Action.

#### Peep
**Level:** 11  
**Target:** Single  
**Type:** Fast Action  
A keen eye is essential to an Engineer’s success. Peep has a CoS of
Expertise, M. Evasion of allowing the Engineer to see a target’s
Level, current and maximum Hit and Magic Points, as well as any
Elemental Weaknesses the target may possess.

#### Reclaim
**Level:** 22  
**Target:** Self  
**Type:** Support Ability  
Clever Engineers can salvage workable parts from almost any
source. Reclaim gives the Engineer a CoS of (Invent Skill Rating) -
40 to recover a single Part after any battle in which at least one
Construct-type opponent was defeated. The exact nature of the Part
is left to the GM’s discretion, but should generally have an Availability
of around 100 - Engineer’s Level. Using Reclaim will not affect any
items or treasure the opponent would normally drop upon defeat.

#### Dismantler
**Level:** 34  
**Target:** Single  
**Type:** Slow Action (10)  
By pilfering vital components from a mechanical opponent, a skilled
Engineer can induce an instant – and destructive – malfunction.
Dismantler has a CoS of Expertise, Evasion of reducing a Construct
target to 0 HP, regardless of its current HP score, Armor, or M.
Armor rating; treat this as a Death effect. This Ability may also be
used to disarm mechanical traps and security measures at the GM’s
discretion.

#### Maintenance
**Level:** 47  
**Target:** Party  
**Type:** Fast Action  
Veteran Engineers keep a close eye on their comrades' equipment,
ensuring that it is always in top condition. Maintenance gives the
Engineer and all active allies in the party Immunity to Weaken-type
Status Conditions (4).

#### Dual Invention
**Level:** 61  
**Target:** Varies  
**Type:** Support Ability  
A master Engineer always has the right device to hand, swapping
Inventions in the blink of an eye. Dual Invention allows the Engineer
to make two consecutive Ability Actions with Inventions of Level 5 or
lower at the cost of a single Action.
