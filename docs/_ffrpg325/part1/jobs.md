title: "Jobs"
---

One does not become a master swordsman or legendary mage by
luck alone; training and experience both play an important part in
the shaping of a hero. Each of the four Classes in the FFRPG –
Warrior, Expert, Adept and Mage – draws its power from a slightly
different source. Fighters tap on chi and physical power, Mages on
the natural force of magic, Experts on their expertise and ingenuity,
and Adepts on a combination of all three. These four Classes are
divided into a number of separate professions based on the heroes
and heroines of the Final Fantasy series – crafty Engineers, sneaky
Thieves, deadly Ninja, noble Dragoons, and more are all represented
here.

## FORMAT

The Jobs presented over the course of this chapter follow a
standard format. After a brief introduction, each has a 'Job profile'
containing the following information:  
**Attribute Bonuses** are given before the profile proper. Added to a
character's Racial Maximums, these determine the caps for the
character's Attributes as a whole as described in Chapter 2.  
**Representatives** lists characters in the Final Fantasy series that
are either known members of the Job in question or embody many
of its qualities. The game each character featured in is given in
(parentheses).  
**HP Die** is used to calculate the Job's Hit Points at character
generation and upon gaining a Level as described in Chapter 2.  
**MP Die** is used to calculate the Job's Magic Points at character
generation and upon gaining a Level as described in Chapter 2.  
**Weapons** lists the Weapon types this Job is proficient with. Weapon
types not listed in a Job’s profile may not be wielded by a character
unless they have the Advantage Special Training. The one exception
to this are Thrown Weapons, which may be used by all Jobs.  
**Armor** lists the Armor types this Job is proficient with. Armor types
not listed in a Job's profile may not be worn by a character unless
they have the Advantage Special Training.  
**Accuracy Bonus** varies from Job to Job, and is used to calculate to
the character's Accuracy as per Chapter 2.  
Skill Points give the number of Skill Points a character of this Job
can spend at character creation.  
**Skill Aptitude** lists the Skill Category the character can buy Skills at
half cost from.  
The Job's Ability Set is presented after the profile, presenting each
individual Ability in an easy-to-read format. For Spell-casting Jobs,
the Ability Set also contains a table showing when new Spells are
gained, if applicable.  
>! Abilities and Two Weapons  
Unless its description says otherwise, all offensive Abilities are
limited to a single Weapon at a time. If the character has more
than one Weapon equipped, decide which one to use.
